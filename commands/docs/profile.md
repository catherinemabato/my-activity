# <code>{{ $frontmatter.title }}</code> for debug

<div class='command-title'>{{ $frontmatter.debug }}</div>

## Signature

```> profile (closure) --source --values --max-depth```

## Parameters

 -  `closure`: the closure to run
 -  `--source` `(-)`: Collect source code in the report
 -  `--values` `(-)`: Collect values in the report
 -  `--max-depth {int}`: How many levels of blocks to step into (default: 1)

## Notes
The command collects run time of every pipeline element, recursively stepping into child closures
until a maximum depth. Optionally, it also collects the source code and intermediate values.

Current known limitations are:
* profiling data from subexpressions is not tracked
* it does not step into loop iterations
## Examples

Profile some code, stepping into the `spam` command and collecting source.
```shell
> def spam [] { "spam" }; profile {|| spam | str length } -d 2 --source

```

## Signature

```> str substring (range) ...rest --grapheme-clusters --utf-8-bytes```

## Parameters

 -  `range`: the indexes to substring [start end]
 -  `...rest`: For a data structure input, turn strings at the given cell paths into substrings
 -  `--grapheme-clusters` `(-g)`: count indexes and split using grapheme clusters (all visible chars have length 1)
 -  `--utf-8-bytes` `(-b)`: count indexes and split using UTF-8 bytes (default; non-ASCII chars have length 2+)

## Examples

Get a substring "nushell" from the text "good nushell" using a range
```shell
>  'good nushell' | str substring 5..12
```

Alternately, you can pass in a list
```shell
>  'good nushell' | str substring [5 12]
```

Or a simple comma-separated string
```shell
>  'good nushell' | str substring '5,12'
```

Drop the last `n` characters from the string
```shell
>  'good nushell' | str substring ',-5'
```

Get the remaining characters from a starting index
```shell
>  'good nushell' | str substring '5,'
```

Get the characters from the beginning until ending index
```shell
>  'good nushell' | str substring ',7'
```

Count indexes and split using grapheme clusters
```shell
>  '🇯🇵ほげ ふが ぴよ' | str substring -g 4..6
```

# Bashisms

A frequently asked question is, "What bashims does Nushell support?". Frequently these questions revolve around bang bang functionality.

## What is a bashism

A bashism is a command, operator, or syntax in the repl that most people associate with bash.

## What bashisms does Nushell support?

### Bang Bang syntax

In reedline we support these bashisms.

1. `!!` - Repeat the last command.
2. `!n` - Repeat the nth command from your nushell history.
3. `!-n` - Repeat the nth command from your last history entry.
4. `!$` - Get the last spatially separated token from the last command in your history.
5. `!term` - Repeat the last command match a strings beginning.

#### How to invoke bang bang syntax

In nushell when you type a bang command, it performs that functionality and places the result in the nushell command line buffer in the repl. It does not execute it.

# Nushell 0.72

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your commandline. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful commandline pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.72 of Nu. This release includes [SUMMARY GOES HERE]

# Where to get it

Nu 0.72 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.72.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

If you want all the built-in goodies, such as support for dataframes and SQLite databases, you can install it via `cargo install nu --features=extra`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Themes of this release

## Command refinement, simplification, and elimination

This release contains many breaking changes to Nu's built-in commands (sorry!). As we move toward version 1.0 we want to ensure that Nu ships with a small curated set of consistent, well-designed "standard library" commands. This requires taking a hard look at existing commands, and in some cases breaking changes are unavoidable. We expect that this effort will span a few release cycles.

## Dataframes no longer included by default - smaller binaries

Nu's dataframe support is extensive, impressive, and very useful to users who rely on it. However, it comes at a high cost in terms of compile time, binary size, and complexity. Starting with version 0.72, dataframe commands are no longer included in the release binaries published on GitHub or the default binaries published via package managers (like Homebrew, winget, Scoop). As a result of this change, the main Nu executable is now about 50% smaller.

To continue using dataframe commands, you can build Nu from source using the `dataframe` [Cargo feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html). For example, to install using Cargo: `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`

# Breaking changes

- As mentioned above, dataframe support has been removed from the default Nu binaries.
- [Nu's SQLite DSL commands have been removed](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7040). `open foo.db` and `open foo.db | query db "SELECT * ..."` still work, but the commands which mapped 1-to-1 with SQL clauses (ex: `open foo.db | into db | select * | from table some_table | order-by some_column`) have been removed. These commands were an interesting experiment but they didn't work out, and we're removing them to simplify database access in Nu.
- [The `is_plugin`, `is_custom`, and `is_keyword` columns in `help commands` have been replaced with a single `command_type` column.](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7052)
- [`date format` now returns an error if not given an input.](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7043) Previously it would default to the current time.
- [The `--predicate` flag has been removed from `find`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7042). `where` can be used in all situations where `find --predicate` was previously used.
- [`sort-by` now requires a column name to sort by](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7042). To sort lists without specifying a column name, `sort` can be used.
- `seq`, `seq char`, and `seq date` no longer have `--separator` and `--terminator` flags ([#7045](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7045), [#7054](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7054), [#7096](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7096)). This helps ensure that the return type for those commands is consistent, and `str join` can be used to accomplish the same effect.
- [The `build-string` command has been removed](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7144). To concatenate strings, use the `+` operator, [string interpolation](https://www.nushell.sh/book/working_with_strings.html#string-interpolation), or `str join`.
- [`wrap` now expands ranges](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7159). It works the same as with lists or `seq`.
- [`url parse` `url scheme`, `url host`, `url path`, and `url quey` commands have been removed. We added the command `url parse`.](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7124) This new command returns a Record with scheme, username, password, host, path, query, params (as a Record) and fragment.
- [`sort`, `sort-by`, `str contains` and `find` have had their `--insensitive` flags renamed to `--ignore-case`.](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7198). `--ignore-case` is used by `uniq`, as well as popular external commands like `less`, `grep` and `wget`, so it could be considered a standard flag name.

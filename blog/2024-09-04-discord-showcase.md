# Nushell Showcase on Discord

Last week, we added a new channel to our Discord server. The [#Showcase](https://discord.com/channels/601130461678272522/1277584399323627572) is the place to show off all the cool Nushell-related things you have created!

Artwork, Plugins, Blog posts, Videos, etc.!

You may also want to submit your post to our official [awesome-nu repo](https://github.com/nushell/awesome-nu) or the [showcase repo](https://github.com/nushell/showcase). Have fun!

# Nushell 0.86

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->

Today, we're releasing version 0.86 of Nu. This release adds fish-like directory completions, type system improvements, our first officially supported uutils command, and much more.

# Where to get it

Nu 0.86 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.86.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

> :bulb: **Note**
> The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

## Improving the completions in the [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) [[toc](#table-of-content)]

With Nushell `0.86.0` come a few improvements to the completions!

[@ZerdoX-x](https://github.com/ZerdoX-x) did add built-in support for the `doas` command in addition
to `sudo` in [#10256](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10256).

In [#10543](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10543), [@lavafroth](https://github.com/lavafroth)
have implement _Fish-like completions for nested directories_. This means that now typing `tar/de/inc`
in the [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) of Nushell and
hitting TAB will autocomplete to `./target/debug/incremental` if you are in a Rust directory with
compiled artifact.

![Animation showing shorthand directory expansion](../assets/images/0_86_completions.gif)

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::
As a consequence to [#10543](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10543), [@sophiajt](https://github.com/sophiajt)
helped remove the _cd with abbreviation_ feature from Nushell.
This feature will be taken care of by the _Fish-like completions_ described above and the removal
mainly means that `$env.config.cd.abbreviations` is not longer a valid config field: do not forget
to update your configs :wink:

## The type system [[toc](#table-of-content)]

With this new release, we are still working on the type system of Nushell.

[@WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder) has been working on the arguments and options of
custom commands. With [#10424](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10424), default values won't
overwrite type annotations anymore, i.e. the following is now possible:

```nushell
def foo [x: any = null] { print $"$x" }

foo "string"  # will show `x: string`
foo null      # will show `x: `
```

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::
Continuing with the options on custom commands, let's talk about an important change introduced by
[#10456](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10456) about _boolean_ switches:

- annotating a _boolean_ option will create an option and will require to pass a boolean value

```nushell
def foo [--option: bool] { if $option { print "yeah" } }

foo --option        # will give an error
foo --option false  # won't print anything
foo --option true   # will print "yeah"
```

- to create a _boolean_ switch, you need to omit the type annotation

```nushell
def bar [--switch] { if $switch { print "yeah" } }

bar           # won't print anything
bar --switch  # will print "yeah"
```

> :bulb: **Note**
> Boolean options are one step towards addressing a major pain point of Nushell: Passing flags around to other commands.
> Calling a command with a flag, such as `def inner [--foo] { ... }`, from another command used to require `if`-`else` to pass the flag:
>
> ```nushell
> def outer [--foo] {
>    if $foo {
>        inner --foo
>    } else {
>        inner
>    }
> }
> ```
>
> With boolean options, it is now possible to define `def inner [--foo: bool] { ... }` and then call simply as
>
> ```nushell
> def outer [--foo] {
>    inner --foo $foo
> }
> ```

Once again, [@NotLebedev](https://github.com/NotLebedev) has been pushing forward type annotations
to their limits, this time by allowing complex types in input/output signaturate for custom commands
and in `let` assignments. This means that [#10405](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10405)
allows one to write things like:

```nushell
let my_r: record<a :int> = { a: 123 }
```

or

```nushell
def my_complex_command []: nothing -> record<a: int> { { a: 123 } }
```

## Unified command definitions

Nushell currently has three ways to define a command:

- `def` to define a regular command
- `def-env` to define a command that preserves the environment
- `extern-wrapped` to define a command with a signature where unknown flags and parameters are collected into strings without throwing an error
- (`extern` defines an external signature, not a real command)

In this release, [@kubouch](https://github.com/kubouch) unified the syntax in [#10566](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10566) such that the `def-env` and `extern-wrapped` are now defined with the `--env` and `--wrapped` options to the `def` keyword.
We made this change to go in line with the `let-env` removal and simplifying the language in general.
Also, confusingly, `extern-wrapped` has nothing to do with `extern` apart from the permissive signature.
We hope the new notation makes it clearer.
A bonus feature of this change is that now you can define `def --env --wrapped`!

> :bulb: **Note**
> In the next release, `def-env` and `extern-wrapped` will get deprecated. If you have any of those definitions in your scripts, simply replace them with `def --env` or `def --wrapped`. In the following releases, they will be removed completely.

## Some news with the standard library [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@Yethal](https://github.com/Yethal) and their work in [#10545](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10545),
the use of the test runner and the `std testing run-tests` command should be faster!

Work has been done to improve the `std log` module:

- [@gaetschwartz](https://github.com/gaetschwartz) allow specifying a custom date format with [#10603](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10603)
- [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) remove the underline from `NU_LOG_FORMAT` with [#10604](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10604)

Finally, a bug with `std dirs goto`, a _shell_ command in the _prelude_ of the library, has been
fixed by [@bobhy](https://github.com/bobhy) in [#10706](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10706).

## Miscellaneous [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Nushell now supports the _keyboard enhancement protocol_ from [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
with the work of [@Abdillah](https://github.com/Abdillah) in [#10540](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10540).
This feature is off by default but can be turned on in `config.nu` with the `$env.use_kitty_protocol`
config option.

Nushell and Direnv are now integrated with each other thanks to [@amtoine](https://github.com/amtoine)
in [direnv/direnv#1175](https://github.com/direnv/direnv/pull/1175) and
[#10675](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10675).

With the changes from [#10593](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10593) written by
[@gaetschwartz](https://github.com/gaetschwartz), `open` can now read `tar.gz` file because `from`
can handle multiple extensions. To be more precise, if `from tar.gz` and `from gz` are defined at the
same time, `open foo.tar.gz` will try to call `from tar.gz` first and then fall back to `from gz`.

Let's finish with some delight to make the Nushell experience a bit nicer:

- transient prompts are now possible introduced in [#10391](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10391)
  by [@ysthakur](https://github.com/ysthakur)
- `LS_COLORS` supports `.fb2` files as text documents thanks to [@1256-bits](https://github.com/1256-bits)
  in [#10532](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10532)
- a few more grid icons have been added by [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) in [#10583](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10583)

## Our set of commands is evolving [[toc](#table-of-content)]

As usual, new release rhyms with changes to commands!

It's official! 🥳 With the landing of PR [10678](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10678) the
uutils/coreutils version of `cp` is now the default copy command in nushell. We're so happy to have
this command landed and we're working on several other commands. If you'd like to help out please
visit our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NtAbbGn) and ask about helping. The
[coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils) team would also appreciate your help since changes
need to be made there before integrating into nushell.

### New commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

- when parsing raw data streams from external commands, a common task in Nushell is to give explicit
  types to all fields and columns of the parsed data structure. Until now, this had to be done manually
  but, thanks to [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) and [#10427](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10427),
  the new `into value` command should help make that task easier by trying to infer the types for you:

```nushell
# should help you catch integer user and group IDs in the `/etc/passwd` file on *nix systems
open /etc/passwd | lines | split column ":" user . uid gid desc home shell | into value
```

- [@zhiburt](https://github.com/zhiburt) did add an `--abbreviated` option to `table` to truncate the
  output of long tables in [#10399](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10399)
- to get the content of the default config files of Nushell without overwriting the true `config.nu`
  and `env.nu`, [@poliorcetics](https://github.com/poliorcetics) have added the `--default` option to
  both `config nu` and `config env` in [#10480](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10480)
- to know about all the available escapes that Nushell supports, [@vedaRadev](https://github.com/vedaRadev)
  have added `help escapes` in [#10522](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10522)
- tired of crawling the internet or computing series of number with loops and mutable variables?
  [@hudclark](https://github.com/hudclark) got your back with the new `unfold` command from [#10489](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10489)!
  The first 10 Fibonacci numbers can now be computed very easily with something like

```nushell
unfold [0, 1] {|fib| {out: $fib.0, next: [$fib.1, ($fib.0 + $fib.1)]} } | first 10
```

To crawl multi-page API responses, e.g. when listing issues of a GitHub repository, the `unfold` is
very handy and allows to transform

```nushell
mut pages = []
for page in 1.. {
  let resp = http get (
    {
      scheme: https,
      host: "api.github.com",
      path: "/repos/nushell/nushell/issues",
      params: { page: $page, per_page: $PAGE_SIZE }
    } | url join)

  $pages = ($pages | append $resp)

  if ($resp | length) < $PAGE_SIZE {
    break
  }
}
$pages
```

into

```nushell
unfold 1 {|page|
  let resp = http get (
    {
      scheme: https,
      host: "api.github.com",
      path: "/repos/nushell/nushell/issues",
      params: { page: $page, per_page: $PAGE_SIZE }
    } | url join)

  if ($resp | length) < $PAGE_SIZE {
    {out: $resp}
  } else {
    {out: $resp, next: ($page + 1)}
  }
}
```

- in previous release, `from ndjson` and `from jsonl` have been added to the standard library. In this
  new release, [@amtoine](https://github.com/amtoine) has added their `to` counterpart in [#10519](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10519)
- to complete `url encode`, `url decode` has been added by [@lpchaim](https://github.com/lpchaim) in [#10611](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10611)
- `dfr` to get some help on dataframes by [@sholderbach](https://github.com/sholderbach) in [#10683](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10683)
- our mascot `ellie` has been added to the standard library by [@amtoine](https://github.com/amtoine) in [#10686](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10686)
- complementary to the `sys` command, `debug info`, added by [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) in
  [#10711](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10711), should give more insight into the resources
  Nushell is using at runtime

### Changes to existing commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The `open` command is now case-insensitive when it comes to file extensiens thanks to
[@poketch](https://github.com/poketch) in [#10451](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10451).

A bug inside `from ics` and `from vcf` has been fixed thanks to [@joergsch](https://github.com/joergsch)
in [#10577](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10577).

:::
With [#10526](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10526) from [@WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder),
the `--column` option of the `rename` command now takes a `record` instead of a `list`:

```nushell
> ls | where type == file | rename --column {name: filename, size: nb_bytes}
#┬filename─┬type┬nb_bytes┬─────modified──────
0│LICENSE  │file│ 35.1 KB│2022-12-23 11:34:42
1│README.md│file│  9.3 KB│2023-10-04 18:41:25
─┴─────────┴────┴────────┴───────────────────
```

The `do` command can now mutate its outside environment with a new `--env` option added by [@ClipplerBlood](https://github.com/ClipplerBlood)
in [#10572](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10572). This means that the following will now be possible:

```nushell
do --env { cd some/where }
```

#### A few updates on the `explore` command [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Once again, [@rgwood](https://github.com/rgwood) has done work to simplify the `explore` command

- the highlighting of selected cells has been made easier to see in [#10533](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10533) |
- some config options have been removed in[#10559](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10559),
  [#10562](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10562) and [#10570](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10570)

### Deprecated commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The following commands and options are being deprecated and will be removed soon:

- `random int` in favor of `random integer` in [#10520](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10520)
- the `$nothing` built-in variable in favor of the `null` value in [#10478](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10478)
- `to xml --pretty {int}` in favor of `to xml --indent {int}` in [#10660](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10660)

### Removed commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The following commands are being removed from Nushell:

- `random decimal` in favor of `random float` in [#10342](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10342)
- `into decimal` in favor of `into float` in [#10341](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10341)

# Breaking changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

- [#10456](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10456) differentiating between `--x` and `--x: bool`

In 0.86, we now differentiate between a switch `--x` and a flag with a boolean argument `--x: bool`. If you declare a flag as a parameter and give it the `: bool` type annotation, we now require that the flag is followed by a boolean value. Previously, we took the boolean type to mean that the flag was actually a switch.

- [#10680](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10680) Use `heck` for string casing (again)

## Before

```nushell
> [UserID ABCdefGHI foo123bar] | str camel-case
╭───┬───────────╮
│ 0 │ userID    │
│ 1 │ abcdefGHI │
│ 2 │ foo123Bar │
╰───┴───────────╯
> [UserID ABCdefGHI foo123bar] | str snake-case
╭───┬─────────────╮
│ 0 │ user_id     │
│ 1 │ ab_cdef_ghi │
│ 2 │ foo_12_3bar │
╰───┴─────────────╯
```

## After

```nushell
> [UserID ABCdefGHI foo123bar] | str camel-case
╭───┬───────────╮
│ 0 │ userId    │
│ 1 │ abCdefGhi │
│ 2 │ foo123bar │
╰───┴───────────╯
> [UserID ABCdefGHI foo123bar] | str snake-case
╭───┬─────────────╮
│ 0 │ user_id     │
│ 1 │ ab_cdef_ghi │
│ 2 │ foo123bar   │
╰───┴─────────────╯
```

- [#10341](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10341) remove `into decimal`
- [#10342](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10342) remove `random decimal`
- [#10588](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10588) Remove cd w/ abbreviations

`cd` with abbreviations was a feature you could enable to expand an abbreviated path for you automatically. It would do so after you hit return. In comparing the experience between this and the fish-like path abbreviation completions added in 0.86, we decided the new style of completions satisfied this in a much more visual way.

- [#10526](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10526) Rename: change the SyntaxShape of `-c` flag from list to record

After this change, we need to use -c flag like this:

```
> [[a, b, c]; [1, 2, 3]] | rename -c { a: ham }
But we can rename many columns easily, here is another example:
```

```
> [[a, b, c]; [1, 2, 3]] | rename -c { a: ham, b: ham2 }
```

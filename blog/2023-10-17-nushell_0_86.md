## The type system
With this new release, we are still working on the type system of Nushell.

[@WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder) has been working on the arguments and options of
custom commands. With [#10424](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10424), default values won't
overwrite type annotations anymore, i.e. the following is now possible:
```nushell
def foo [x: any = null] { print $"$x }

foo "string"  # will show `x: string`
foo null      # will show `x: `
```

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::
Continuing with the options on custom commands, let's talk about an important change introduced by
[#10456](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10456) about *boolean* switches:
- annotating a *boolean* option will create an option and will require to pass a boolean value
```nushell
def foo [--option: bool] { if $option { print "yeah" } }

foo --option        # will give an error
foo --option false  # won't print anything
foo --option true   # will print "yeah"
```
- to create a *boolean* switch, you need to omit the type annotation
```nushell
def bar [--switch] { if $switch { print "yeah" } }

bar           # won't print anything
bar --switch  # will print "yeah"
```

Once again, [@NotLebedev](https://github.com/NotLebedev) has been pushing forward type annotations
to their limits, this time by allowing complex types in input/output signaturate for custom commands
and in `let` assignments. This means that [#10405](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10405)
allows one to write things like:
```nushell
let my_r: record<a :int> = { a: 123 }
```
or
```nushell
def my_complex_command []: nothing -> record<a: int> { { a: 123 } }
```

## Improving the completions in the [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)
With Nushell `0.86.0` come a few improvements to the completions!

[@ZerdoX-x](https://github.com/ZerdoX-x) did add built-in support for the `doas` command in addition
to `sudo` in [#10256](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10256).

In [#10543](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10543), [@lavafroth](https://github.com/lavafroth)
have implement *Fish-like completions for nested directories*. This means that now typing `tar/de/inc`
in the [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) of Nushell and
hitting TAB will autocomplete to `./target/debug/incremental` if you are in a Rust directory with
compiled artifact.

As a consequence to [#10543](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10543), [@jntrnr](https://github.com/jntrnr)
helped remove the *cd with abbreviation* feature from Nushell.
This feature will be taken care of by the *Fish-like completions* described above and the removal
mainly means that `$env.config.cd.abbreviations` is not longer a valid config field: do not forget
to update your configs :wink:

## Some news with the standard library
Thanks to [@Yethal](https://github.com/Yethal) and their work in [#10545](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10545),
the use of the test runner and the `std testing run-tests` command should be faster!

Work has been done to improve the `std log` module:
- [@gaetschwartz](https://github.com/gaetschwartz) allow specifying a custom date format with [#10603](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10603)
- [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) remove the underline from `NU_LOG_FORMAT` with [#10604](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10604)

Finally, a bug with `std dirs goto`, a *shell* command in the *prelude* of the library, has been
fixed by [@bobhy](https://github.com/bobhy) in [#10706](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10706).

## Our set of commands is evolving
As usual, new release rhyms with changes to commands!

It's official! 🥳 With the landing of PR [10678](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10678) the
uutils/coreutils version of `cp` is now the default copy command in nushell. We're so happy to have
this command landed and we're working on several other commands. If you'd like to help out please
visit our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NtAbbGn) and ask about helping. The
[coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils) team would also appreciate your help since changes
need to be made their before integrating into nushell.

### New commands
- when parsing raw data streams from external commands, a common task in Nushell is to give explicite
types to all fields and columns of the parsed data structure. Until now, this had to be done manually
but, thanks to [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) and [#10427](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10427),
the new `into value` command should help make that task easier by trying to infer the types for you:
```nushell
# should help you catch integer user and group IDs in the `/etc/passwd` file on *nix systems
open /etc/passwd | lines | split column ":" user . uid gid desc home shell | into value
```
- [@zhiburt](https://github.com/zhiburt) did add an `--abbreviated` option to `table` to truncate the
output of long tables in [#10399](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10399)
- to get the content of the default config files of Nushell without overwritting the true `config.nu`
and `env.nu`, [@poliorcetics](https://github.com/poliorcetics) have added the `--default` option to
both `config nu` and `config env` in [#10480](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10480)
- to now about all the available escapes that Nushell supports, [@vedaRadev](https://github.com/vedaRadev)
have added `help escapes` in [#10522](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10522)
- tired of crawling the internet or computing series of number with loops and mutable variables?
[@hudclark](https://github.com/hudclark) got your back with the new `unfold` command from [#10489](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10489)!
The first 10 Fibonacci numbers can now be computed very easily with something like
```nushell
unfold [0, 1] {|fib| {out: $fib.0, next: [$fib.1, ($fib.0 + $fib.1)]} } | first 10
```
To crawl multi-page API responses, e.g. when listing issues of a GitHub repository, the `unfold` is
very handy and allows to transform
```nushell
mut pages = []
for page in 1.. {
  let resp = http get (
    {
      scheme: https,
      host: "api.github.com",
      path: "/repos/nushell/nushell/issues",
      params: { page: $page, per_page: $PAGE_SIZE }
    } | url join)

  $pages = ($pages | append $resp)

  if ($resp | length) < $PAGE_SIZE {
    break
  }
}
$pages
```
into
```nushell
unfold 1 {|page|
  let resp = http get (
    {
      scheme: https,
      host: "api.github.com",
      path: "/repos/nushell/nushell/issues",
      params: { page: $page, per_page: $PAGE_SIZE }
    } | url join)

  if ($resp | length) < $PAGE_SIZE {
    {out: $resp}
  } else {
    {out: $resp, next: ($page + 1)}
  }
}
```
- in previous release, `from ndjson` and `from jsonl` have been added to the standard library. In this
new release, [@amtoine](https://github.com/amtoine) has added their `to` counterpart in [#10519](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10519)
- to complete `url encode`, `url decode` has been added by [@lpchaim](https://github.com/lpchaim) in [#10611](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10611)
- `dfr` to get some help on dataframes by [@sholderbach](https://github.com/sholderbach) in [#10683](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10683)
- our mascot `ellie` has been added to the standard library by [@amtoine](https://github.com/amtoine) in [#10686](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10686)
- complementary to the `sys` command, `debug info`, added by [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) in
[#10711](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10711), should give more insight into the resources
Nushell is using at runtime

### Changes to existing commands
The `open` command is now case-insensitive when it comes to file extensiens thanks to
[@poketch](https://github.com/poketch) in [#10451](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10451).

A bug inside `from ics` and `from vcf` has been fixed thanks to [@joergsch](https://github.com/joergsch)
in [#10577](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10577).

With [#10526](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10526) from [@WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder),
the `--column` option of the `rename` command now takes a `record` instead of a `list`:
```nushell
> ls | where type == file | rename --column {name: filename, size: nb_bytes}

#### A few updates on the `explore` command
Once again, [@rgwood](https://github.com/rgwood) has done work to simplify the `explore` command
- the highlighting of selected cells has been made easier to see in [#10533](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10533) |
- some config options have been removed in[#10559](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10559),
[#10562](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10562) and [#10570](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10570)

### Deprecated commands
The following commands and options are being deprecated and will be removed soon:
- `random int` in favor of `random integer` in [#10520](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10520)
- the `$nothing` built-in variable in favor of the `null` value in [#10478](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10478)
- `to xml --pretty {int}` in favor of `to xml --indent {int}` in [#10660](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10660)

### Removed commands
The following commands are being removed from Nushell:
- `random decimal` in favor of `random float` in [#10342](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10342)
- `into decimal` in favor of `into float` in [#10341](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10341)

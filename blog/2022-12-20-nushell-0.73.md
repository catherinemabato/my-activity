# Nushell 0.73

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.73 of Nu. This release includes many new features: new math commands, an interactive data viewer, and many command refinements
<!-- more -->

# Where to get it

Nu 0.73 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.73.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

NOTE: as part of this release, we are no longer including additional features in `--features=extra`. With the previous 0.72 release, SQLite features had moved into the main Nushell installation and dataframe functionality is now part of `--features=dataframe`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Themes of this release / New features

## Interactive `explore` data viewer ([zhiburt](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6984))

## Redirection

Continued work has improved how you can redirect STDOUT and STDERR to files

## Command refinement, simplification, and elimination

This release contains many breaking changes to Nu's built-in commands (sorry!). As we move toward version 1.0 we want to ensure that Nu ships with a small curated set of consistent, well-designed "standard library" commands. This requires taking a hard look at existing commands, and in some cases breaking changes are unavoidable. We expect that this effort will span a few release cycles.

### New `math` commands ([sholderbach](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7258))

With this release we include a larger number of `math` commands for real valued math such as trigonometric functions and logarithms.
The goal is to remove the `math eval` command that operates on strings instead of proper nushell expressions.

#### Constants

- `math pi`
- `math tau`
- `math e`

#### Trigonometry and hyperbolic functions

- `math sin`
- `math cos`
- `math tan`
- `math sinh`
- `math cosh`
- `math tanh`
- `math arcsin`
- `math arccos`
- `math arctan`
- `math arcsinh`
- `math arccosh`
- `math arctanh`

#### Logarithms

- `math log`
- `math ln`

``` sh
> math pi | math cos
-1
> math e | math ln
1
> [16 8 4 2] | math log 2
[4 3 2 1]
```

## New command `uniq-by` ([raccmonteiro](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7295))

To complement `uniq` which can identify unique or duplicated values in a collection or report the number of occurrences for a particular entry, we now have `uniq-by`.
It supports filtering a table by entries appearing in a particular column.

```
〉[[fruit day]; [apple monday] [apple friday] [Apple friday] [apple monday] [pear monday] [orange tuesday]] | uniq-by fruit
╭───┬────────┬─────────╮
│ # │ fruit  │   day   │
├───┼────────┼─────────┤
│ 0 │ apple  │ monday  │
│ 1 │ Apple  │ friday  │
│ 2 │ pear   │ monday  │
│ 3 │ orange │ tuesday │
╰───┴────────┴─────────╯
```

# Breaking changes

- [The `--show-created-paths` flag has been replaced by `--verbose` from `mkdir`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7462).

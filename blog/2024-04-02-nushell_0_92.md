# Nushell 0.92

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->
Today, we're releasing version 0.92 of Nu. This release adds...

# Where to get it

Nu 0.92 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.92) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

::: tip Note
The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.
:::

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

### Persistent plugins [[toc](#table-of-content)]

A major enhancement for plugin users: plugins can now run persistently in the background and serve multiple calls before exiting! :tada:

This improves the performance of plugin commands considerably, because starting a process has a much more considerable overhead than talking to an existing one:

```nushell
# 0.91.0
> 1..1000 | each { timeit { "2.3.2" | inc -m } } | math avg
2ms 498µs 493ns

# 0.92.0 (8x faster!)
> 1..1000 | each { timeit { "2.3.2" | inc -m } } | math avg
308µs 577ns
```

That difference is even more significant for plugins written in JIT or interpreted languages:

```nushell
# 0.91.0
> 1..100 | each { timeit { nu-python 1 foo } } | math avg
40ms 704µs 902ns

# 0.92.0 (47x faster!)
> 1..1000 | each { timeit { nu-python 1 foo } } | math avg
871µs 410ns
```

This will open the door to plugins that would have otherwise been too slow to be useful, particularly in languages that have a reputation for being slow to cold start, like Java and other JVM languages.

By default, plugins will stay running for 10 seconds after they were last used, and quit if there is no activity. This behavior is [configurable](/book/plugins.md#plugin-garbage-collector):

```nushell
$env.config.plugin_gc = {
    # Settings for plugins not otherwise specified:
    default: {
        enabled: true # set to false to never automatically stop plugins
        stop_after: 10sec # how long to wait after the plugin is inactive before stopping it
    }
    # Settings for specific plugins, by plugin name
    # (i.e. what you see in `plugin list`):
    plugins: {
        gstat: {
            stop_after: 1min
        }
        inc: {
            stop_after: 0sec # stop as soon as possible
        }
        stream_example: {
            enabled: false # never stop automatically
        }
    }
}
```

Aside from performance, this also enables plugins to have much more advanced behavior. Plugins can now maintain state across plugin calls, and for example use a handle custom value to track resources that remain in the plugin's process without having to be serialized somehow, or implement caches to speed up certain operations that are repeated often.

For more details on how to manage plugins with this change, see the newly added [`plugin list`](#plugin-list-toc) and [`plugin stop`](#plugin-stop-toc) commands.

### Plugin API overhaul [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

::: warning
Plugins are no longer launched in the current working directory of the shell. Instead, they are launched in the directory of their plugin executable. See [this section](/contributor-book/plugins.md#launch-environment) of the plugins guide for details.
:::

This release brings major reorganization to the plugin API. The [`Plugin`](https://docs.rs/nu-plugin/0.92.0/nu_plugin/trait.Plugin.html) trait now specifies a list of [`PluginCommand`](https://docs.rs/nu-plugin/latest/nu_plugin/trait.PluginCommand.html) trait objects, which implement both the signature and the functionality for that command. Dispatching the commands by name is now handled by `serve_plugin()` automatically, so no more `match` statements! This should make creating plugins that expose many commands much easier, and also makes a one-command-per-module pattern easier to follow.

`StreamingPlugin` has been removed. Instead, `PluginCommand` uses the streaming API, with `PipelineData` input and output, and `SimplePluginCommand` has value input and output just as before.

The arguments passed to `run()` have also changed. It now takes `&self` rather than `&mut self`, and all plugins and commands are required to be `Sync`, so that they can be safely shared between threads. Use thread-safe state management utilities such as those found in `std::sync` to create stateful plugins.

The `config` parameter has been removed and replaced with an `EngineInterface` reference, which supports many more functions, including `get_plugin_config()` to get the config.

Other added functionality on `EngineInterface`:

- Get the engine `Config`: see `get_config()` (part of [#12029](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12029))
- Evaluate closure: see `EngineInterface::eval_closure()`, `eval_closure_with_stream()` (part of [#12029](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12029))
- Get environment variables and working directory: `get_env_var()`, `get_env_vars()`, `get_current_dir()` ([#12166](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12166))
- Set environment variables in caller's scope: `add_env_var()` ([#12204](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12204))
- Plugin garbage collection disable/enable: `set_gc_disabled()` (part of [#12064](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12064))

See the [docs](https://docs.rs/nu-plugin/0.92.0/nu_plugin/struct.EngineInterface.html) for details on what can be done with the `EngineInterface`.

A complete example of the new API organization from the [plugin docs](/contributor-book/plugins.md):

```rust
use nu_plugin::{serve_plugin, LabeledError, JsonSerializer, EvaluatedCall};
use nu_plugin::{Plugin, PluginCommand, SimplePluginCommand, EngineInterface};
use nu_protocol::{Value, PluginSignature, Type};

struct LenPlugin;

impl Plugin for LenPlugin {
    fn commands(&self) -> Vec<Box<dyn PluginCommand<Plugin = Self>>> {
        vec![
            Box::new(Len),
        ]
    }
}

struct Len;

impl SimplePluginCommand for Len {
    type Plugin = LenPlugin;

    fn signature(&self) -> PluginSignature {
        PluginSignature::build("len")
            .usage("calculates the length of its input")
            .input_output_type(Type::String, Type::Int)
    }

    fn run(
        &self,
        _plugin: &LenPlugin,
        _engine: &EngineInterface,
        call: &EvaluatedCall,
        input: &Value,
    ) -> Result<Value, LabeledError> {
        let span = input.span();
        match input {
            Value::String { val, .. } => Ok(
                Value::int(val.len() as i64, span)
            ),
            _ => Err(LabeledError {
                label: "Expected String input from pipeline".to_string(),
                msg: format!("requires string input; got {}", input.get_type()),
                span: Some(call.head),
            }),
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    serve_plugin(&LenPlugin, JsonSerializer)
}
```

## Improved plugin custom values [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Custom values returned by plugins previously had very limited functionality - they could really only be sent back to the same plugin in another command. This release expands the number of supported operations:

- Cell paths (e.g. `$custom_value.0` and `$custom_value.field`)
- Operators (e.g. `$custom_value + $other`, `$custom_value ++ "plain value"`)
- Comparisons (for compatibility with `sort`)
- [Drop notification](/contributor-book/plugins.md#drop-notification) (useful for implementing handles)

For more information, see [the plugins guide](/contributor-book/plugins.md#custom-values) and [`CustomValue` docs](https://docs.rs/nu-plugin/0.92.0/nu_protocol/trait.CustomValue.html).

## Our set of commands is evolving [[toc](#table-of-content)]
As usual, new release rhyms with changes to commands!

### New commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

#### `plugin list` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

As part of the plugin persistence update, this command shows you not only all of the plugins you have installed and their commands, but also whether they are running and what their process ID is if they are:

```nushell
> plugin list
╭───┬─────────┬────────────┬─────────┬───────────────────────┬───────┬───────────────────────────────╮

│   │         │            │         │                       │       │ ╰───┴─────╯                   │
│ 2 │ example │ false      │         │ .../nu_plugin_example │       │ ╭───┬───────────────────────╮ │
│   │         │            │         │                       │       │ │ 0 │ nu-example-1          │ │
│   │         │            │         │                       │       │ │ 1 │ nu-example-2          │ │
│   │         │            │         │                       │       │ │ 2 │ nu-example-3          │ │
│   │         │            │         │                       │       │ │ 3 │ nu-example-config     │ │
│   │         │            │         │                       │       │ │ 4 │ nu-example-disable-gc │ │
│   │         │            │         │                       │       │ ╰───┴───────────────────────╯ │
╰───┴─────────┴────────────┴─────────┴───────────────────────┴───────┴───────────────────────────────╯
```

You can join the output of this command on `pid` with `ps` in order to get information about the running plugins. For example, to see the memory usage of running plugins:

```nushell
> plugin list | join (ps) pid | select name pid mem
╭───┬───────┬────────┬──────────╮
│ # │ name  │  pid   │   mem    │
├───┼───────┼────────┼──────────┤
│ 0 │ gstat │ 741572 │ 10.2 MiB │
│ 1 │ inc   │ 741577 │  3.6 MiB │
╰───┴───────┴────────┴──────────╯
```

#### `plugin stop` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

If you want to explicitly stop a plugin that's running in the background, you can use the `plugin stop` command. This works even if the plugin signals to Nushell [that it wants to stay running](/contributor-book/plugins.md#disabling-garbage-collection).

```nushell
> plugin stop inc
> plugin list | where is_running and name == inc
╭────────────╮
│ empty list │
╰────────────╯
```

Unlike `kill`, this does not send a signal to the process - it merely deregisters the plugin from Nushell's list of running plugins, which should eventually cause it to exit. If the plugin is unresponsive, you can `kill` its PID:

```nushell
> plugin list | where is_running and name == inc | each { kill $in.pid }
```

### Changes to existing commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

#### `version` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The `version` command has been changed to list plugin names in `plugins`. These reflect the `name` field of `plugin list`. The previous behavior was to list all plugin commands.

#### `ignore` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The `ignore` command has been patched to drop values it receives immediately rather than storing them first. This helps reduce the memory usage of large command output passed to `ignore`.

### Deprecated commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]
### Removed commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

<!-- NOTE: to start investigating the contributions of last release, i like to list them all in a raw table.
    to achieve this, one can use the [`list-merged-prs` script from `nu_scripts`](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs)
    as follows:

    ```nushell
    use ./make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs
    use std clip

    let last_release_date = ^gh api /repos/nushell/nushell/releases
        | from json
        | into datetime published_at
        | get published_at
        | sort
        | last

    let prs = list-merged-prs nushell/nushell $last_release_date
        | where author != "app/dependabot"
        | sort-by mergedAt
        | update url {|it| $"[#($it.number)]\(($it.url)\)" }
        | update author { $"[@($in)]\(https://github.com/($in)\)" }
        | select author title url
        | rename -c {url: pr}
        | to md --pretty

    $prs | to md --pretty | clip
    ```

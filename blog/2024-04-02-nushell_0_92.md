# Nushell 0.92

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->
Today, we're releasing version 0.92 of Nu. This release adds...

# Where to get it

Nu 0.92 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.92) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

::: tip Note
The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.
:::

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

## External command output changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

With [#11934](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11934), we improved the performance of pipelines with external commands.
As part of this effort, Nushell now streams external command output in more places where it is possible.
Namely, parentheses no longer collect external command output and are now solely for grouping and precedence.
For example, take this pipeline:
```nushell
(nu -c "for x in 1.. { try { print $x } catch { break } }")
| lines
| first
```
In previous versions, this would collect the output of `nu` and would not print anything until `ctrl+c` was pressed.
Now, this will immediately print the first line and then immediately finish the pipeline.

So now, external command output will only be collected if it's being turned into a value
(or if it's passed to an internal command that collect its input).
For example, external commands will be collected if it's a command argument:
```nushell
print (^external)
```
Or, if it's being stored in record, list, table, or variable:
```nushell
{
    result: (^external)
}

[(^external)]

let result = ^external
```

"Being turned into a value" now also includes closures in many cases. For example,
`each`, `insert`, `reduce`, and many other commands run closures to compute values.
In these cases, if an external command is in "return position" (it's the last command),
then its output will be collected into a value instead of writing to the terminal/stdio.
For example, the code below used to print `"text"` twice and then return an empty list:
```nushell
1..2 | each { nu -c 'print text' }
```
But now, this will collect the output of `nu`, giving the list `['text', 'text']`.
To achieve the old behavior, you can return `null` instead:
```nushell
1..2 | each { nu -c "print text"; null }
# or, you could use a `for` loop
```

Only a few commands take a closure but do not use it to compute a value:
- `do`
- `with-env`
- `collect`
- `tee`
- `watch`

These commands will not collect external command output from the closure and will instead forward it to the next command in the pipeline or to the terminal/stdio.

Another notable change is that external command output will no longer be implicitly ignored.
For example, external commands in subexpressions that were not the last command used to have their output discarded:
```nushell
(^echo first; ^echo last)
```
Before, this would only print `last`, but now this prints both `first` and `last`.

One final change to note is that external command output now has trailing new lines removed by default.
However, this will not apply if the external command is being redirected to a file, another external command, to the terminal, or to the `complete` command.

## Scoped file redirections [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

File redirections (`o>`, `e>`, `o+e>`, etc.) now apply to all ***external*** commands inside an expression.
For example, the snippet below will redirect stderr from both commands into `err.log`.

```nushell
(nu -c "print -e first"; nu -c "print -e last") e> err.log
# err.log will contain: "first\nlast\n"
```

Note that if there were any custom commands called inside the subexpression,
then any external commands inside the custom command would also use the same file redirection.

```nushell
def cmd [] {
    ^extern1;
    ^extern2
}

(^extern3; cmd) o> out.txt

# output from `extern1`, `extern2`, `extern3` will be redirected to the file
```

## Persistent plugins [[toc](#table-of-content)]

A major enhancement for plugin users: plugins can now run persistently in the background and serve multiple calls before exiting! :tada:

This improves the performance of plugin commands considerably, because starting a process has a much more considerable overhead than talking to an existing one:

```nushell
# 0.91.0
> 1..1000 | each { timeit { "2.3.2" | inc -m } } | math avg
2ms 498µs 493ns

# 0.92.0 (8x faster!)
> 1..1000 | each { timeit { "2.3.2" | inc -m } } | math avg
308µs 577ns
```

That difference is even more significant for plugins written in JIT or interpreted languages:

```nushell
# 0.91.0
> 1..100 | each { timeit { nu-python 1 foo } } | math avg
40ms 704µs 902ns

# 0.92.0 (47x faster!)
> 1..1000 | each { timeit { nu-python 1 foo } } | math avg
871µs 410ns
```

This will open the door to plugins that would have otherwise been too slow to be useful, particularly in languages that have a reputation for being slow to cold start, like Java and other JVM languages.

By default, plugins will stay running for 10 seconds after they were last used, and quit if there is no activity. This behavior is [configurable](/book/plugins.md#plugin-garbage-collector):

```nushell
$env.config.plugin_gc = {
    # Settings for plugins not otherwise specified:
    default: {
        enabled: true # set to false to never automatically stop plugins
        stop_after: 10sec # how long to wait after the plugin is inactive before stopping it
    }
    # Settings for specific plugins, by plugin name
    # (i.e. what you see in `plugin list`):
    plugins: {
        gstat: {
            stop_after: 1min
        }
        inc: {
            stop_after: 0sec # stop as soon as possible
        }
        stream_example: {
            enabled: false # never stop automatically
        }
    }
}
```

Aside from performance, this also enables plugins to have much more advanced behavior. Plugins can now maintain state across plugin calls, and for example use a handle custom value to track resources that remain in the plugin's process without having to be serialized somehow, or implement caches to speed up certain operations that are repeated often.

For more details on how to manage plugins with this change, see the newly added [`plugin list`](#plugin-list-toc) and [`plugin stop`](#plugin-stop-toc) commands.

## Plugin API overhaul [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

::: warning
Plugins are no longer launched in the current working directory of the shell. Instead, they are launched in the directory of their plugin executable. See [this section](/contributor-book/plugins.md#launch-environment) of the plugins guide for details.
:::

This release brings major reorganization to the plugin API. The [`Plugin`](https://docs.rs/nu-plugin/0.92.0/nu_plugin/trait.Plugin.html) trait now specifies a list of [`PluginCommand`](https://docs.rs/nu-plugin/latest/nu_plugin/trait.PluginCommand.html) trait objects, which implement both the signature and the functionality for that command. Dispatching the commands by name is now handled by `serve_plugin()` automatically, so no more `match` statements! This should make creating plugins that expose many commands much easier, and also makes a one-command-per-module pattern easier to follow.

`StreamingPlugin` has been removed. Instead, `PluginCommand` uses the streaming API, with `PipelineData` input and output, and `SimplePluginCommand` has value input and output just as before.

The `signature()` method has been broken up into more methods to reflect the internal `Command` trait. This makes core commands and plugin commands look more similar to each other, and makes it easier to move core commands to plugins if we want to. The new methods are: `name()`, `usage()`, `extra_usage()`, `examples()`, `search_terms()`. `PluginSignature` and `PluginExample` are both no longer needed to be used by plugin developers - just use `Signature` and `Example` like core commands do.

The arguments passed to `run()` have also changed. It now takes `&self` rather than `&mut self`, and all plugins and commands are required to be `Sync`, so that they can be safely shared between threads. Use thread-safe state management utilities such as those found in `std::sync` to create stateful plugins.

The `config` parameter has been removed and replaced with an `EngineInterface` reference, which supports many more functions, including `get_plugin_config()` to get the config. For the other added functionality on `EngineInterface`, see [that section](#plugin-engine-calls-toc).

`LabeledError` has been reworked, and now supports multiple labeled spans and some other attributes that miette provides. This helps to ensure that `ShellError` can generally be passed through a `LabeledError` and still appear the same to the user. A new `ShellError::LabeledError` variant is provided to contain it. More complex plugins might like to implement a `miette::Diagnostic` error, in which case converting to `LabeledError` can be done automatically via `LabeledError::from_diagnostic()`.

A complete example of the new API organization from the [plugin docs](/contributor-book/plugins.md):

```rust
use nu_plugin::{serve_plugin, EvaluatedCall, JsonSerializer};
use nu_plugin::{EngineInterface, Plugin, PluginCommand, SimplePluginCommand};
use nu_protocol::{LabeledError, Signature, Type, Value};

struct LenPlugin;

impl Plugin for LenPlugin {
    fn commands(&self) -> Vec<Box<dyn PluginCommand<Plugin = Self>>> {
        vec![Box::new(Len)]
    }
}

struct Len;

impl SimplePluginCommand for Len {
    type Plugin = LenPlugin;

    fn name(&self) -> &str {
        "len"
    }

    fn usage(&self) -> &str {
        "calculates the length of its input"
    }

    fn signature(&self) -> Signature {
        Signature::build(PluginCommand::name(self))
            .input_output_type(Type::String, Type::Int)
    }

    fn run(
        &self,
        _plugin: &LenPlugin,
        _engine: &EngineInterface,
        call: &EvaluatedCall,
        input: &Value,
    ) -> Result<Value, LabeledError> {
        let span = input.span();
        match input {
            Value::String { val, .. } => Ok(Value::int(val.len() as i64, span)),
            _ => Err(
                LabeledError::new("Expected String input from pipeline").with_label(
                    format!("requires string input; got {}", input.get_type()),
                    call.head,
                ),
            ),
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    serve_plugin(&LenPlugin, JsonSerializer)
}
```

## Plugin engine calls [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The added `EngineInterface` parameter [mentioned previously](#plugin-api-overhaul-toc) enables the following new functionality for plugins:

- Get the engine `Config`: `.get_config()` (part of [#12029](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12029))
- Evaluate closure: `.eval_closure()`, `.eval_closure_with_stream()` (part of [#12029](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12029))
- Get environment variables and working directory: `.get_env_var()`, `.get_env_vars()`, `.get_current_dir()` ([#12166](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12166))
- Set environment variables in caller's scope: `.add_env_var()` ([#12204](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12204))
- Plugin garbage collection disable/enable: `.set_gc_disabled()` (part of [#12064](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12064))
- Get command help text, useful for subcommand collections: `.get_help()` ([#12243](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12243))

See the [docs](https://docs.rs/nu-plugin/0.92.0/nu_plugin/struct.EngineInterface.html) for details and examples on what can be done with the `EngineInterface`.

## Improved plugin custom values [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Custom values returned by plugins previously had very limited functionality - they could really only be sent back to the same plugin in another command. This release expands the number of supported operations:

- Cell paths (e.g. `$custom_value.0` and `$custom_value.field`)
- Operators (e.g. `$custom_value + $other`, `$custom_value ++ "plain value"`)
- Comparisons (for compatibility with `sort`)
- [Drop notification](/contributor-book/plugins.md#drop-notification) (useful for implementing handles)

For more information, see [the plugins guide](/contributor-book/plugins.md#custom-values) and [`CustomValue` docs](https://docs.rs/nu-plugin/0.92.0/nu_protocol/trait.CustomValue.html).

## Plugin test support crate [[toc](#table-of-content)]

With plugins having much more functionality, we thought it would be nice if it were easy to write tests for your plugins, and even test your examples automatically. [Now you can!](/contributor-book/plugins.md#testing-plugins)

Add the `nu-plugin-test-support` crate to your dev-dependencies:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
nu-plugin-test-support = "0.92.0"
```

Then test your examples:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_examples() -> Result<(), nu_protocol::ShellError> {
    use nu_plugin_test_support::PluginTest;
    PluginTest::new("my_plugin", MyPlugin.into())?.test_command_examples(&MyCommand)
}
```

For more information, see the [crate docs](https://docs.rs/nu-plugin-test-support/0.92.0/) and the [contributor book](/contributor-book/plugins.md#testing-plugins).

## Official plugin template [[toc](#table-of-content)]

With this release, we are launching an official template for plugins, to help you get started. Use [cargo-generate](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate):

```
> cargo generate --force --git https://github.com/nushell/nu_plugin_template
🤷   What will this plugin be named?: foo
Creating a new plugin named "foo"
Your plugin crate will be named "nu_plugin_foo".

Note that the MIT license is used by default, to reflect the majority of
Nushell projects. You can change this manually if you'd like to.

!!! IMPORTANT !!!
You must run cargo generate with --force, or it will rename your project to
something that is non-standard for Nushell plugins and this will fail.

If you see a message after this about renaming your project, please abort and
try again with --force.

## Debugging support and proof-of-concept profiler

You may remember that we used to have a `profile` command which then got removed due to unsound implementation. Now, [it's back](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11441) as `debug profile`! You can give it a closure and it will profile each pipeline element in it, stepping recursively into nested blocks/closures/command calls. Make sure to check its help message to understand its output and options.

Under the hood, the profiler uses a new general debugging API that is now hooked into the evaluation engine. The profiler is a proof-of-concept implementation using this API, but we imagine it could be used for other purposes, such as step debugging, code coverage, or even allowing to create custom debugger plugins.

A short user story as an example: The following screenshot shows the profiler output of sourcing kubouch's env.nu file:
![Basic profiling output](../assets/images/0_92_0_debug_profile_basic.png)
You can see that most time is spent inside the `load-env` calls and in the `if (is-windows) { ...`. We can increase the number of blocks to step into with the `--max-depth` flag which reveals more detail:
![Expanded profiling output](../assets/images/0_92_0_debug_profile_expanded.png)
You can notice that most of the expensive pipeline elements have one thing in common: The `is-windows` call. It is a custom command in kubouch's env.nu which internally calls `(sys).host.name` which on kubouch's machine takes around 13 ms. Changing it to use `$nu.os-info.name` and other smaller fixes sped the startup time from 130 to 50 ms.

#### `plugin stop` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

If you want to explicitly stop a plugin that's running in the background, you can use the `plugin stop` command. This works even if the plugin signals to Nushell [that it wants to stay running](/contributor-book/plugins.md#disabling-garbage-collection).

```nushell
> plugin stop inc
> plugin list | where is_running and name == inc
╭────────────╮
│ empty list │
╰────────────╯
```

Unlike `kill`, this does not send a signal to the process - it merely deregisters the plugin from Nushell's list of running plugins, which should eventually cause it to exit. If the plugin is unresponsive, you can `kill` its PID:

```nushell
> plugin list | where is_running and name == inc | each { kill $in.pid }
```

### Changes to existing commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

#### `version` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The `version` command has been changed to list plugin names in `plugins`. These reflect the `name` field of `plugin list`. The previous behavior was to list all plugin commands.

#### `ignore` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

In [#12120](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12120), the `ignore` command has been patched to drop values it receives immediately rather than storing them first.
This helps reduce the memory usage of large command output passed to `ignore`.

#### `insert` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

With [#12209](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12209), if a closure is used to insert new values,
then the `$in` value for the closure will now have the same value as the first parameter of the closure (instead of often being `null`).

#### `complete` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

`complete` now captures stderr output by default, and it is no longer necessary to use `do` in combination with `complete`.

### Deprecated commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

#### `run-external` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

All preexisting flags for `run-external` are now deprecated.

This is because `run-external` now interacts with pipe and file redirections just like if an external command had been run directly.
E.g., `run-external cmd` should be the same as just `^cmd`. The only difference is that `run-external` may have additional flags added in the future for other functionality.
- To achieve the old `--redirect-stdout` behavior, simply use a pipe (`|`).
- Instead of `--redirect-stderr`, use the stderr pipe (`e>|`), or use a regular pipe (`|`) for internal commands that use stderr directly (i.e., `save --stderr` and `tee --stderr`).
- Instead of `--redirect-combine`, use the stdout and stderr pipe (`o+e>|`).

As noted in [External Command Output Changes](#external-command-output-changes-toc),
external command output now has trailing new lines trimmed by default, so the `--trim-end-newline` flag was deprecated as well.

### Removed commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

<!-- NOTE: to start investigating the contributions of last release, i like to list them all in a raw table.
    to achieve this, one can use the [`list-merged-prs` script from `nu_scripts`](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs)
    as follows:

    ```nushell
    use ./make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs
    use std clip

    let last_release_date = ^gh api /repos/nushell/nushell/releases
        | from json
        | into datetime published_at
        | get published_at
        | sort
        | last

    let prs = list-merged-prs nushell/nushell $last_release_date
        | where author != "app/dependabot"
        | sort-by mergedAt
        | update url {|it| $"[#($it.number)]\(($it.url)\)" }
        | update author { $"[@($in)]\(https://github.com/($in)\)" }
        | select author title url
        | rename -c {url: pr}
        | to md --pretty

    $prs | to md --pretty | clip
    ```

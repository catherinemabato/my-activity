# Nushell 0.97.1

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.97.1 of Nu. This release makes parsing of assignments more consistent, enhances path completions, and includes many enhancements to commands.

_**Note:** this was going to be version 0.97.0, but that version had to be yanked due to a last minute bug. This is still the next major version, not a patch release._

# Where to get it

Nu 0.97.1 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.97.1) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

## More consistent parsing of assignment [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#all-breaking-changes-toc)
:::

The assignment operators and `const` have been changed ([#13385](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13385)) to better reflect the behavior used by `let` and `mut`. Before 0.97, these two statements would have been interpreted very differently:

```nushell
mut num = 2 | $in * 4
# equivalent to: mut num = (2 | $in * 4)
$num = 2 | $in * 4
# equivalent to: ($num = 2) | $in * 4
```

Because assignment operators were parsed just like any other operator, they didn't absorb the rest of the pipeline or run commands the same way that `let` and `mut` do, so parentheses were often necessary. This has been changed so that the latter example is now equivalent to `$num = (2 | $in * 4)` instead. The following are also now all possible, and would have been errors before:

```nushell
# $path will be set to 'a/b'
const path = 'a' | path join 'b'

mut x = 2
# $x will be set to a random integer
$x = random int
# $x will be set to 6
# previously `math sum` would have received nothing input
$x = [1 2 3] | math sum

# $env.FOO will be set to a random string
$env.FOO = random chars
```

However, this also introduces a pretty major breaking change. The following would have set variables to strings before:

```nushell
const foo = bar # 'bar'
$quux += baz # appends 'baz'
$env.FOO = `C:\foo\bar\baz.exe`
```

With the new change, these would all be interpreted as commands instead. To try to make this less surprising, we have decided to require the caret (`^`) to be used when invoking external commands from a bare word on the right hand side of an assignment (alone, not within parentheses). Failing to use the caret causes a parse error. If you intend to run the command, simply add the caret:

```nushell
$env.FOO = ^`C:\foo\bar\baz.exe`
```

Otherwise, consider using a type of string that doesn't cause command execution:

```nushell
$env.FOO = 'C:\foo\bar\baz.exe'
```

## Enhancements to path completions [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#all-breaking-changes-toc)
:::

Thanks to [@lavafroth](https://github.com/lavafroth) in [#13302](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13302), path completions now explicitly check for and prefer an exact match for a basename instead of longer or similar names.

Also, thanks to [@lyuha](https://github.com/lyuha) in [#13321](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13321), when completing paths on Windows, the last path separator in use will now be preserved. If the path was most recently using forward slashes, the completion will suggest a forward slash, but if it was using backslashes (as is conventional for Windows), it will continue to suggest backslashes. This should make things a bit more ergonomic for those who prefer to use forward slashes on Windows.

# Changes to commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## Additions [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `random binary` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@KAAtheWiseGit](https://github.com/KAAtheWiseGit) in [#13542](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13542), the `random binary` command was added. This command has one required parameter which is the number of bytes to generate.

```nushell
> random binary 16
Length: 16 (0x10) bytes | printable whitespace ascii_other non_ascii
00000000:   28 99 b7 0e  c0 2f 02 0c  d8 5a b9 69  72 36 86 30   (××•×/•_×Z×ir6×0
```

### `mv --update` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

In [#13505](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13505), [@Embers-of-the-Fire](https://github.com/Embers-of-the-Fire) added the `--update`/`-u` flag to `mv`. This has the same behavior/purpose as the `--update` flag on `cp`. Namely:

> move and overwrite only when the SOURCE file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missing

### `print --raw` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

In [#13597](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13597), the `--raw` flag was added to `print`. This will bypass any pretty formatting from `table` and instead write data directly to stdout or stderr.

### `polars save` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The `polars sink` and `polars to-*` commands have been merged ([#13568](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13568)) into a single command, `polars save`. This change helps to choose the most efficient option possible for lazyframes, allowing them to stream out to disk when supported.

### multipart/form-data [[toc](#table-of-content)]

In [#13532](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13532), thanks to [@weirdan](https://github.com/weirdan), the `http post` command now supports the `multipart/form-data` content type.

## Breaking changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `ps` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@qfel](https://github.com/qfel), after [#13618](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13618), the name column from the `ps` command will now contain the name of the process instead of its path.

### `ls` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

After [#13479](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/13479), the `--full-paths`/`-f` flag for `ls` will cause the paths in the `target` column to be fully qualified paths.

### `stor` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@maxim-uvarov](https://github.com/maxim-uvarov) in [#13464](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13464), `stor` no longer implicitly removes ansi escape sequences from strings that will be stored.

### `save` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Streams from external commands will now ([#13422](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13422)) have their stderr printed to `nu`'s stderr, if captured but not used.

### `polars open` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

`polars open` will now open a lazyframe by default ([#13556](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13556)). The `--lazy` option has been removed, and `--eager` has been added instead, to explicitly open an eager dataframe.

## Removals [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `polars to-*` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The `polars to-*` commands have been superseded by [`polars save`](#polars-save-toc).

## Bug fixes and other changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### const math commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

In [#13566](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13566), [@Qnbie](https://github.com/Qnbie) has made more math commands usable in constant evaluation:

- `math abs`
- `math avg`
- `math ceil`
- `math floor`
- `math log`
- `math max`
- `math median`
- `math min`
- `math mode`
- `math product`
- `math round`
- `math stddev`
- `math sqrt` ([#13487](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13487))
- `math sum`
- `math variance`

### `glob` accepts globs [[toc](#table-of-content)]

After [#13612](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13612), `glob` now also takes globs (in addition to strings) as the first parameter.

### `into datetime` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@NotTheDr01ds](https://github.com/NotTheDr01ds) in [#13541](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13541), integer values can now be piped into `into datetime` in combination with a format string. The integers will be interpreted based on the format string. Example:

```nu
1724112000 | into datetime -f '%s'
# => Tue, 20 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000 (now)
```

### `reduce` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) in [#13461](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13461), the accumulator argument is now also passed as pipeline input to the closure provided to `reduce`.

### `split words` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@weirdan](https://github.com/weirdan) in [#13502](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13502), `split words` no longer removes digits and instead treats them as part of a word.

### `query web` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@Embers-of-the-Fire](https://github.com/Embers-of-the-Fire), some potential panics for `query web` were fixed in [#13507](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13507).

Additionally, thanks to [@jameschensmith](https://github.com/jameschensmith) in [#13538](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13538), an issue with values appearing in the wrong column due to missing data was fixed.

# All breaking changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

- [#13618](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13618) Prefer process name over executable path
- [#13568](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13568) Merge `polars sink` and `polars to-*` to `polars save`
- [#13556](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13556) `polars open` will now open a lazy frame by default
- [#13302](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13302) feat: prefer exact match when completion mode is prefix
- [#13422](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13422) save: print to stderr for bytestream
- [#13385](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13385) Make assignment and `const` consistent with `let`/`mut`
- [#13464](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13464) don't force stripping ansi codes from strings in `stor`

# Notes for plugin developers [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## Interrupt signals for plugins [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Interrupt (ctrl-C) signals are now available to plugins, thanks to [@cablehead](https://github.com/cablehead) in [#13181](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13181). The [`EngineInterface::register_signal_handler`](https://docs.rs/nu-plugin/0.97.1/nu_plugin/struct.EngineInterface.html#method.register_signal_handler) method is used to set up a handler for interrupt & clear signals. A new plugin input message, [`Signal`](/contributor-book/plugin_protocol_reference.md#signal), has been added to support this functionality. For non-Rust plugins, please be sure to add support for this message as appropriate.

## Pipeline metadata added to protocol [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The metadata of `PipelineData` has been added to the protocol in [#13495](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13495), ensuring that metadata can be preserved across plugin calls, or used by plugins as appropriate.

This required some pretty significant changes to `PipelineDataHeader`, with `Value` now being a tuple variant, and the `ListStreamInfo` and `ByteStreamInfo` now containing `metadata` fields. Non-Rust plugins will definitely need to be updated to be compatible with this change. Please check that your plugins conform to the updated [documentation](/contributor-book/plugin_protocol_reference.md). There are no API changes to `nu-plugin` required, so Rust plugins should just need to be recompiled.

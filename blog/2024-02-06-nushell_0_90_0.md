# Nushell 0.90.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->
Today, we're releasing version 0.90.0 of Nu. This release adds...

# Where to get it

Nu 0.90.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.90.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

::: tip Note
The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.
:::

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

## New Reedline coolness

We have some exciting new improvements in our line editor, thanks to [unprecedented number of contributions](https://github.com/nushell/reedline/releases/tag/v0.29.0) since the last release.

First, the matching prefix of a completion is now highlighted (note that this doesn't work with fuzzy completions yet):

![image](https://github.com/nushell/nushell.github.io/assets/343840/2d05a1e3-fb9a-4db9-94dd-63f2679a733b)

Second, completion menus now have more of an IDE feel to them [#11593](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11593)

![image](https://github.com/nushell/nushell.github.io/assets/343840/1e15a21e-2d3b-42c3-b0db-80a49f6b593d)

Third, shift navigation ([#11535](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11535)) now allows selecting and pasting text by holding the Shift key:

![select2](https://github.com/nushell/nushell.github.io/assets/343840/2e7c9bea-c4eb-47b3-8787-94a875603476)

All the new changes are configurable: See the [changes to the default config file](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/compare/0.89.0...main#diff-5c0320ebb54cd8ffd7059eb0178377c5139877d21457f6903439e7caf2e5b40e) (if the link does not bring you to the `default_config.nu` file, click the "Files changed" tab, then search for "default_config.nu" and open the diff) to see what has changed.

## Integration of more [uutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils) commands

Continuing our cooperation with uutils, we now have a new `umv` command, implemented by uutils, which will replace our current `mv` [#10822](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10822).

Our `old-cp` was also removed [#11622](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11622) and now we rely solely on `cp` from `uutils`

## Starting a new [Language Reference](https://www.nushell.sh/lang-guide)

Recently, we started a new reference page for Nushell language and its features.
For years, we have used the [current book](https://www.nushell.sh/book) as both a reference point for Nushell's features _and_ a tutorial.
The result is that it is too verbose to be used as a quick reference page, and  due to its exhaustiveness it is also hard to keep concise as a tutorial.
The story-like writing style makes it also harder to keep up to date.
Over time, we hope to offload content from the book to the reference page that should be less verbose and easier to update.
At the same time, we aim to refactor the book into more of a tutorial style and make it more coherent.
Practical recipes for solving common problems continue being collected in the [cookbook](https://www.nushell.sh/cookbook).

## Parse-time evaluation

String interpolation can be now performed at parse time [#11562](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11562).
This gives you another way to, for example, compose files for importing or sourcing, for example:
```nushell
const name = spam
use ($nu.default-config-dir | path join $"($name).nu")
```


The `ansi` commands now can also be evaluated at parse time: [#11682](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11682)

## Glob changes

* Do not expand glob if in quotes: [#11569](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11569)
* Unifying glob behavior: [#11621](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11621)
* New `str escape-glob` (see below)

From this release, we unified glob rules for the following commands: `open`, `rm`, `cp`, `umv`, `mv`, `du`.

The general rules is: If given parameter is quoted by single quote(') or double quote("), don't auto-expand the glob pattern.
If not quoted(or using backtick quote<code>`</code>), auto-expand the glob pattern.

So if you have the following files: `aac.txt`, `abc.txt`, `a[ab]c.txt`, then:

* `ls a[ab]c.txt` matches `aac.txt`, `abc.txt`
* `rm "a[bc]c.txt"` removes a file named `a[bc]c.txt`
* <code>ls `C:\Program Files\a[ab]c.txt`</code> matches `aac.txt`, `abc.txt`

But if you save a file name in a variable, e.g: `let f = "a[ab]c.txt"`, then `ls $f` matches `aac.txt`, `abc.txt`.
To escape the glob pattern to match a file named `a[bc]c.txt`, `str escape-glob` comes to play: `ls ($f | str escape-glob)`.

`str escape-glob` is useful when you are using a closure: `ls | str escape-glob name | each {|it| ls $it}`, so you won't get error occasionally.

## Dataframes: allow specifying schema [#11634](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11634)

## New CLI flag: `--no-history` [#11550](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11550)

If nushell is launched with the `--no-history` CLI flag, then command history file will not be read from or written to.
You can check whether history is enabled using `$nu.history-enabled`.
It will be false if `--no-history` was provided and true otherwise.

## Strict JSON parsing [#11592](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11592)

The `from json` command now has a `--strict` flag which will error on invalid JSON.
For example, comments and trailing commas are not allowed in JSON,
and so will trigger an error with the `--strict` flag.

## Our set of commands is evolving [[toc](#table-of-content)]
As usual, new release rhyms with changes to commands!

### New commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

New [`into cellpath`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11322)
[`str escape-glob`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11664) -- goes with glob unification changes in [#11621](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11621)

### Changes to existing commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]
### Deprecated commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]
### Removed commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

<!-- NOTE: to start investigating the contributions of last release, i like to list them all in a raw table.
    to achieve this, one can use the [`list-merged-prs` script from `nu_scripts`](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs)
    as follows:

    ```nushell
    use ./make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs
    use std clip

    let last_release_date = ^gh api /repos/nushell/nushell/releases
        | from json
        | into datetime published_at
        | get published_at
        | sort
        | last

    let prs = list-merged-prs nushell/nushell $last_release_date
        | where author != "app/dependabot"
        | sort-by mergedAt
        | update url {|it| $"[#($it.number)]\(($it.url)\)" }
        | update author { $"[@($in)]\(https://github.com/($in)\)" }
        | select author title url
        | rename -c {url: pr}
        | to md --pretty

    $prs | to md --pretty | clip
    ```

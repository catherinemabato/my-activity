# Nushell 0.82

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.82 of Nu. This release focuses on polishing the user experience.

# Where to get it

Nu 0.82 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.82.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

NOTE: The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Themes of this release / New features

## REPL: Mark line entries as excluded from the history by leading with a space ([samlich](https://github.com/nushell/reedline/pull/566))
In some situations you may want to avoid storing an entry inside your shell history. For example if it includes a secret or running it again in a different context could be dangerous.
To stop nushell from storing a particular line in its history you can now start with a space and it will be ignored. You can still recall your last entry once by pressing the `Up-Arrow` but the command will never be written to disk and disappear as soon as you submit another command.

# Breaking changes

- [#9407](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9407) In the `ls --long` output the `uid` column has been renamed to `user` to be consistent with `group`
- [#9427](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9427) The filesize prefixes `Z`/`Zi` have been removed as their underlying values where not correctly representable.

# Nushell 0.99.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->

Today, we're releasing version 0.99.0 of Nu. This release adds...

# Where to get it

Nu 0.99.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.99.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

    the following command should help pre-generate a great deal of the table of content.
    be careful with the format and false-positives :wink:
    ```nushell
    rg '^#+ ' blog/...
        | lines
        | each {
            str replace '# ' '- '
                | str replace --all '#' '    '
                | str replace --regex '- (.*)' '- [_$1_](#$1-toc)'
        }
        | to text

# Changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## Additions [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## Breaking changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### Standard Library

The internal storage location for the standard library, as well as how it is handled during Nushell start-up, has changed to improve launch times. While every effort has been made to ensure backward-compatibility, there may be some corner-cases in how other scripts and modules have imported `std` in the past.

If you run into an issue, try the following import pattern. Replace `log` or `formats` with the module name you are using:

```nu
# If the module commands should be "prefixed", e.g., `log warning "Hello"`
use std/log

# When the module's command names should be available in the current namespace
# E.g., `ls | to jsonl`
use std/formats *
```

Refer to the [Standard Library](/book/standard_library.md) documentation for more information.

## Deprecations [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### Standard Library - Directory Stack / Shells / dirs Module

- [#13842](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13842): Starting with the next release, Nushell will no longer automatically load the `std/dirs` aliases at startup. In 0.99.0, using one of these aliases (`n`, `p`, `g`, `enter`, `dexit`, or `shells`) will result in a warning message.

  To disable the warning message and prepare for 0.100.0, add the following to your startup configuration (typically `config.nu` or `env.nu`, etc.):

  ```nu
  use std/dirs shells-aliases *
  ```

  See the [Shells in Shells](/book/shells_in_shells.html) chapter of the Book for more options.

## Removals [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## Bug fixes and other changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

<!-- NOTE: to start investigating the contributions of last release, i like to list them all in a raw table.
    to achieve this, one can use the [`list-merged-prs` script from `nu_scripts`](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs)
    as follows:

    ```nushell
    use ./make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs
    use std clip

    let last_release_date = ^gh api /repos/nushell/nushell/releases
        | from json
        | into datetime published_at
        | get published_at
        | sort
        | last

    let prs = list-merged-prs nushell/nushell $last_release_date
        | sort-by mergedAt
        | update url {|it| $"[#($it.number)]\(($it.url)\)" }
        | update author { $"[@($in)]\(https://github.com/($in)\)" }
        | select author title url
        | rename -c {url: pr}
        | to md --pretty

    $prs | to md --pretty | clip
    ```

# Nushell 0.99.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->

Today, we're releasing version 0.99.0 of Nu. This release adds...

# Where to get it

Nu 0.99.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.99.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## Additions [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `enhanced keybinding configuration` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

**Support for Unicode Code Points in Keycodes.**

Starting from [#14020](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14020), users can now specify characters in the keycode field using their Unicode code points, in the format `char_uXXXX`, where `XXXX` is the hexadecimal Unicode code point. This provides greater flexibility when configuring keybindings in Nushell.

Specifying Unicode code points can help eliminate confusion when characters from different Unicode blocks look identical but have different code points. For example, by using `char_u0041` for the Latin `A`, `char_u0391` for the Greek `Α`, or `char_u0410` for the Cyrillic `А`, users can accurately define keybindings and avoid ambiguity in configurations.

**Key Feature:**

The current implementation does not restrict the number of leading zeroes when specifying Unicode code points. For example, the character `A` can be represented as `char_u41,` `char_u0041`, or even `char_u000041`. However, it is recommended to use four hexadecimal digits (e.g., `char_u0041`) to improve readability and maintain a consistent format across different configurations. This recommendation follows the standard Unicode representation and helps prevent ambiguity.

**Example usage:**

```nushell
$env.config = {
    ...

    keybindings: [
        {
            name: <command_name>, # name of the command
            modifier: none,       # key modifier
            keycode: char_u0391,  # Unicode code for Greek 'Α'
            mode: vi_normal,      # mode in which this binding should work
            event: {
                send: <action>    # action to be performed
            }
        }
    ]

    ...
}
```

## Breaking changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### Standard Library

The internal storage location for the standard library, as well as how it is handled during Nushell start-up, has changed to improve launch times. While every effort has been made to ensure backward-compatibility, there may be some corner-cases in how other scripts and modules have imported `std` in the past.

If you run into an issue, try the following import pattern. Replace `log` or `formats` with the module name you are using:

```nu
# If the module commands should be "prefixed", e.g., `log warning "Hello"`
use std/log

# When the module's command names should be available in the current namespace
# E.g., `ls | to jsonl`
use std/formats *
```

Refer to the [Standard Library](/book/standard_library.md) documentation for more information.

## Deprecations [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### Standard Library - Directory Stack / Shells / dirs Module

- [#13842](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13842): Starting with the next release, Nushell will no longer automatically load the `std/dirs` aliases at startup. In 0.99.0, using one of these aliases (`n`, `p`, `g`, `enter`, `dexit`, or `shells`) will result in a warning message.

  To disable the warning message and prepare for 0.100.0, add the following to your startup configuration (typically `config.nu` or `env.nu`, etc.):

  ```nu
  use std/dirs shells-aliases *
  ```

  See the [Shells in Shells](/book/shells_in_shells.html) chapter of the Book for more options.

## Removals [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## Bug fixes and other changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

<!-- NOTE: to start investigating the contributions of last release, i like to list them all in a raw table.
    to achieve this, one can use the [`list-merged-prs` script from `nu_scripts`](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs)
    as follows:

    ```nushell
    use ./make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs
    use std clip

    let last_release_date = ^gh api /repos/nushell/nushell/releases
        | from json
        | into datetime published_at
        | get published_at
        | sort
        | last

    let prs = list-merged-prs nushell/nushell $last_release_date
        | sort-by mergedAt
        | update url {|it| $"[#($it.number)]\(($it.url)\)" }
        | update author { $"[@($in)]\(https://github.com/($in)\)" }
        | select author title url
        | rename -c {url: pr}
        | to md --pretty

    $prs | to md --pretty | clip
    ```

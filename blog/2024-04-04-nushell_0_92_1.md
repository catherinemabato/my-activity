# Nushell 0.92.1

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.92.1 of Nu, a hotfix release for 0.92.0. This release fixes the following bugs and regressions present in 0.92.0:

- The configured hooks should again properly affect the scope (e.g. virtualenv integrations using a hook to activate as an overlay) ([#12383](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12383))
- `mkdir`/`touch` did not correctly resolve relative paths after using `cd`. This is now fixed. ([#12394](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12394))
- The default config file created by 0.92.0 assumed that you built with the default feature set including the `system-clipboard`. This is not working on platforms like Android/Termux (termux builds with `default-no-clipboard`). Now we only create keybindings in `config.nu` that are supported on all platforms and provide suggestions as comments. You may want to recreate `config.nu` with 0.92.1 if you run into this issue. ([#12385](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12385))
- The timing of drop notifications sent to plugins has been corrected. ([#12341](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12341))

::: warning Breaking change
A breaking change to the Rust API of `nu-protocol` was inadvertently added to the 0.92.1 patch release in PR [#12341](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12341). Specifically, the method `as_mut_any()` was added to `CustomValue`, for accessing custom values' data with a mutable reference. This change requires custom value types to implement the method, which breaks API compatibility. Nushell scripts are not affected.

# Nushell 0.93.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->

Today, we're releasing version 0.93.0 of Nu. This release adds...

# Where to get it

Nu 0.93.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.93.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

::: tip Note
The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.
:::

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

## Redesigned plugin management commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Deprecation warning
`register` is now deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. Read this section for alternatives.
:::

We've changed the way plugins are managed in Nushell in this release. In 0.92 and earlier, plugins were added with `register`, e.g.:

```nushell
> register ~/.cargo/bin/nu_plugin_gstat
```

This ran the plugin to get the signatures of the commands it supports, and then did two things: it added them to your `$nu.plugin-file` (previously called `plugin.nu`), so that they would be ready next time `nu` is run without having to ask the plugin again, and it also added them to your scope so you could use them immediately. While this was convenient, it had the drawback of always running the plugin at parse time (see issue [#11923](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/11923)), which was less than ideal.

We now have two commands to replace `register` that break this functionality into two steps:

1. [`plugin add`](#plugin-add-toc), a normal command, which runs the plugin to get command signatures and adds them to your `$nu.plugin-file`, replacing any existing plugin definition with the same name
2. [`plugin use`](#plugin-use-toc), a parser command, which loads the plugin command signatures from your `$nu.plugin-file` and makes them available in scope.

The previous example would now be equivalent to this, at the REPL:

```nushell
# Add the plugin's commands to your plugin registry file:
> plugin add ~/.cargo/bin/nu_plugin_gstat

# Load it into scope:
> plugin use gstat
```

Note that this _will not_ work in a script in this order, as `plugin use` is a [parser command](/book/thinking_in_nu.md#think-of-nushell-as-a-compiled-language) and would get evaluated first. If you would like to make sure a certain plugin is available in a script, there are a few options:

1. Prepare a plugin registry file in advance, and use `--plugin-config` with `plugin use`:
   ```nushell
   plugin use --plugin-config /path/to/custom.msgpackz your_required_plugin
   ```
2. The same thing, but pass the `plugin config` to `nu`:
   ```nushell
   nu --plugin-config /path/to/custom.msgpackz your-script.nu
   ```
3. Pass a NUON list to `--plugins` (new in 0.93) to `nu`, to use plugins without a registry file:

   ```nushell
   nu --plugins '[/path/to/nu_plugin_your_required_plugin]' your-script.nu

   # or you can use `to nuon` from inside nu:
   let plugins = [
       '/path/to/nu_plugin_foo'
       '/path/to/nu_plugin_bar'
   ]
   nu --plugins ($plugins | to nuon) your-script.nu
   ```

The last option will run the plugin to get signatures at startup, without modifying the user's registry file, and can even be used when `--no-config-file` is specified.

Finally, we have also added [`plugin rm`](#plugin-rm-toc), which removes a plugin from the registry file. This was something that previously needed to be done manually in a text editor, but is made possible by the new format.

## New plugin registry format [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

The plugin registry format has been changed from the previous Nushell script format (containing a sequence of `register` commands) to a custom, declarative format based on [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) compressed with [brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli). This new format is called `msgpackz`, and the default plugin file is `plugin.msgpackz` instead of `plugin.nu`.

Your existing `plugin.nu` file will be automatically upgraded to `plugin.msgpackz` the first time version 0.93 runs.

The declarative format brings a number of benefits:

1. It can be edited more structurally, allowing us to replace the entire definition of one plugin at once, which is more logically consistent if a plugin removes commands from one version to the next, and also allowing us to support new commands like [`plugin rm`](#plugin-rm-toc).
2. It supports adding metadata about plugins as a whole rather than just the command signatures, if we need to.
3. It contains the Nushell version that generated it, allowing us to potentially fix issues between versions.
4. It fails gracefully - if something about a particular plugin can't be parsed because of a change to the serialization format, other plugins that don't have that issue can still load.

We chose to use compressed MessagePack because it is very fast to load, and the file is loaded every time `nu` starts, so with a lot of plugins or plugins that expose a lot of commands (e.g. the new `polars` plugin), this was a big problem for startup times in general.

The most significantly _breaking_ part of this breaking change is that the following is no longer possible:

```nushell
source $nu.plugin-file
```

You can use the [`plugin use`](#plugin-use-toc) command instead to (re-)load a specific plugin from the plugin registry file:

```nushell
> plugin use gstat
```

## Improved terminal interaction for plugins [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Plugins are now able to run over a UNIX domain socket or Windows named pipe instead of `stdin`/`stdout` if they support it ([#12448](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12448)). All Rust plugins support this mode by default, but it is optional; plugins written in other languages are not forced to implement this, and the stdio mode is still always attempted. The [feature is advertised as `LocalSocket`](/contributor-book/plugin_protocol_reference.md#localsocket-feature) and the upgrade is automatic when supported by the plugin and confirmed to be functional.

This frees up stdio for interaction with the user's terminal, which makes plugins that rely on that, including terminal UI plugins like @amtoine's [`nu_plugin_explore`](https://github.com/amtoine/nu_plugin_explore) simpler and more reliable to implement.

We also added [engine calls](/contributor-book/plugin_protocol_reference.md#enterforeground-engine-call) for moving the plugin into the terminal controlling (foreground) process group, mainly for Unix platforms. This was also necessary to fully support terminal UI plugins, after the last release's new persistence functionality caused plugins to run in a new, background process group by default.

## Our set of commands is evolving [[toc](#table-of-content)]

As usual, new release rhyms with changes to commands!

### New commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

#### `plugin add` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Adds a plugin to the plugin registry file (default `$nu.plugin-path`).

```nushell
plugin add ~/.cargo/bin/nu_plugin_gstat
```

A different registry file can be used if desired:

```nushell
plugin add --plugin-config ~/polars.msgpackz ~/.cargo/bin/nu_plugin_polars
```

Replaces part of `register`, but can be used as a normal command, so it can be used within a script on a generated path. For example the following is now possible:

```nushell
glob ~/.cargo/bin/nu_plugin_* | each { |file| plugin add $file }
```

#### `plugin rm` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Removes a plugin from the plugin registry file (default `$nu.plugin-path`).

```nushell
plugin rm gstat
plugin rm --plugin-config ~/polars.msgpackz polars
```

The commands will still remain in scope, but will not be present the next time `nu` is started.

#### `plugin use` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Loads a plugin from the plugin registry file (default `$nu.plugin-path`) **at parse time**.

This replaces the other part of `register` - actually adding the commands to scope. It does not run the plugin executable, though, it just loads the [previously added](#plugin-add-toc) commands from the registry file.

### Changes to existing commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### Deprecated commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

#### `register` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

This command is deprecated in favor of the new [`plugin add`](#plugin-add-toc) and [`plugin use`](#plugin-use-toc) commands. See the [relevant section](#redesigned-plugin-management-commands-toc) for the reasoning behind this change.

### Removed commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

<!-- NOTE: to start investigating the contributions of last release, i like to list them all in a raw table.
    to achieve this, one can use the [`list-merged-prs` script from `nu_scripts`](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs)
    as follows:

    ```nushell
    use ./make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs
    use std clip

    let last_release_date = ^gh api /repos/nushell/nushell/releases
        | from json
        | into datetime published_at
        | get published_at
        | sort
        | last

    let prs = list-merged-prs nushell/nushell $last_release_date
        | where author != "app/dependabot"
        | sort-by mergedAt
        | update url {|it| $"[#($it.number)]\(($it.url)\)" }
        | update author { $"[@($in)]\(https://github.com/($in)\)" }
        | select author title url
        | rename -c {url: pr}
        | to md --pretty

    $prs | to md --pretty | clip

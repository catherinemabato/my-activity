# Nushell 0.93.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->
Today, we're releasing version 0.93.0 of Nu. This release adds...

# Where to get it

Nu 0.93.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.93.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

::: tip Note
The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.
:::

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

## Our set of commands is evolving [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### New commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]
### Changes to existing commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

#### `with-env` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes-toc)
:::

The environment variable list form of `with-env` is now deprecated aftter [#12523](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12523):
```nushell
with-env [X Y W Z] { $env.X }
```

Instead, one should use the record form:
```nushell
with-env { X: 'Y', W: 'Z' } { $env.X }
```

Additionally, setting the `PWD` variable through `with-env` is now disallowed.

#### `load-env` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes-toc)
:::

With [#12522](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12522), setting the `PWD` variable through `load-env` is now disallowed.


#### `last` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes-toc)
:::

To be consistent with `first` and other commands, `last` now errors if the input is empty ([#12478](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12478)).

To suppress the error and return null if an input is empty, wrap `last` in a `try` block:
```nushell
[] | try { last }
```

#### `drop` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes-toc)
:::

With [#12479](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12479), `drop` will now error if the number of rows/columns is negative.

#### `skip` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes-toc)
:::

To be consistent with `take` and other commands, `skip` no longer accepts external streams as input ([#12559](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12559)).

#### `group-by` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes-toc)
:::

If a closure was used as the grouper for `group-by`, then errors inside the closure would previously be ignored. Instead, `group-by` would put the row/item under the `error` group.
With [#12508](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12508), errors are no longer ignored and will immediately be bubbled up.

#### `timeit` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes-toc)
:::

After [#12465](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12465), the `timeit` command will no longer capture external command output, instead redirecting output to the terminal/stdio.

#### `kill` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes-toc)
:::

The `kill` command used to return a stream of values in certain cases. In [#12480](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12480) this was changed so that `kill` now always returns a single value (null or a string).

#### `ls` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Instead of a single optional path, the `ls` command now takes a rest argument of paths ([#12327](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12327)). I.e., you can spread a list into `ls`:
```nushell
ls ...[directory1 directory2]
```
or simply `ls` multiple directories:
```nushell
ls directory1 directory2
```

#### `du` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

In the `ls` PR ([#12327](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12327)), the same changes were also made to `du`. So now, `du` takes a rest argument of paths just like `ls`.

#### `into filesize` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@singh-priyank](https://github.com/singh-priyank) in [#12443](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12443), `into filesize` can now parse negative filesizes from strings.

#### `explain` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

With [#12432](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12432), the `type` column returned from `explain` should no longer contain `string` for every row.

### Deprecated commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]
### Removed commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

<!-- NOTE: to start investigating the contributions of last release, i like to list them all in a raw table.
    to achieve this, one can use the [`list-merged-prs` script from `nu_scripts`](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs)
    as follows:

    ```nushell
    use ./make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs
    use std clip

    let last_release_date = ^gh api /repos/nushell/nushell/releases
        | from json
        | into datetime published_at
        | get published_at
        | sort
        | last

    let prs = list-merged-prs nushell/nushell $last_release_date
        | where author != "app/dependabot"
        | sort-by mergedAt
        | update url {|it| $"[#($it.number)]\(($it.url)\)" }
        | update author { $"[@($in)]\(https://github.com/($in)\)" }
        | select author title url
        | rename -c {url: pr}
        | to md --pretty

    $prs | to md --pretty | clip
    ```

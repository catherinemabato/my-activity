# Nushell 0.69

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your commandline. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful commandline pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.69 of Nu. This release includes TODO 
<!-- more -->

# Where to get it

Nu 0.69 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.69.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

If you want all the built-in goodies, you can install `cargo install nu --features=extra`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Themes of this release

## We make nushell nice

## (Major changes!) Finishing the rework of modules and environment

_Some of the changes here have far-reaching consequences and it might take a while to get the book up to speed._


### Summary

Here is a table that summarizes the changes:

| command | previous release (0.67) | this release (0.68) | next release (0.69) |
| ------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- | ---

# Breaking changes


# Next Steps

We've been progressing with our design towards 0.80 as outlined in [this Notion page](https://kubouch.notion.site/4db276462ba24704919edb4cc4b86be7?v=10506505557f4f7b9a65155128c04250).

Some time was spent trying out possible new syntax directions but we were not confident to release them yet. In the next release we'll see a removal of features deprecated in this release and we'll continue to push ahead for the 0.80.

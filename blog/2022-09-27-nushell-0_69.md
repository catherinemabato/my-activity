# Nushell 0.69

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your commandline. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful commandline pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.69 of Nu. This release includes TODO 
<!-- more -->

# Where to get it

Nu 0.69 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.69.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

If you want all the built-in goodies, you can install `cargo install nu --features=extra`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Themes of this release

## We make nushell nice

## Finishing the rework of modules and environment ([WindSoilder, kubouch](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6468))

If you followed the development since the last release, you might have noticed we successfully applied "the method of dead ends" pioneered by [JÃ¡ra Cimrman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1ra_Cimrman): "Somebody had to probe this dead end of human knowledge and announce to the world: Not this way, friends!"
In short, the `source-env` experiment did not work out as planned.
We hoped to allow to call `source-env` with dynamic paths which, however, proved unfeasible.
Therefore, in this release, we remove all notions of `source-env` from Nushell and instead **`use` will be used activate the module's environment**.
Any call to `use` will run the module's `export-env { ... }` block (if there is one) and keep its environment.
A positive side of it is that one call of `use` is enough to import both commands/aliases and the environment, there is no need to call two separate commands as we planned for `source-env`.

We're also keeping the `source` command for now, as well as the current config file format.
One reason is that we want to first investigate whether it is possible to export also regular variables from modules and whether we can use the `module` keyword inside modules.
However, the use of modules is still preferred over `source` as it will become the default way in the future.

### Summary

Here is a recap of the table posted in the previous release post with updated entries.

* Technically, `hide` still hides environment variables but it works in a "compatibility mode" that is intended to only serve its purpose in the virtualenv activation script. As soon as the virtualenv integration gets updated, hiding environment variables with `hide` will be removed completely.

## Upcoming `virtualenv` activation changes (kubouch)

To reflect the recent changes to the module environment, we are changing the virtualenv integration to use overlays.
This will come in effect as soon as [this PR](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/pull/2422) gets merged.
In practice, this means that instead of `source activate.nu`, you'll use `overlay use activate.nu`, `deactivate` will work the same.

Under the hood, calling `overlay use activate.nu` will activate the `activate` overlay and `deactivate` is just an alias for calling `overlay hide activate`.
If you wish, you can manually name the overlay, for example `overlay use activate.nu as spam`, but then you'd need to remove it with `overlay hide spam` instead of `deactivate`.

# Breaking changes


# Next Steps

We've been progressing with our design towards 0.80 as outlined in [this Notion page](https://kubouch.notion.site/4db276462ba24704919edb4cc4b86be7?v=10506505557f4f7b9a65155128c04250).

Some time was spent trying out possible new syntax directions but we were not confident to release them yet. In the next release we'll see a removal of features deprecated in this release and we'll continue to push ahead for the 0.80.

# Nushell 0.27

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your commandline. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful commandline pipelines.

Today, we're releasing 0.27 of Nu. This release fixes some long-standing issues with Nushell.

While there's still much work to do to achieve a 1.0 release, this proposal will let the community help refine and correct the direction. We're looking forward to kicking this off in the coming weeks.

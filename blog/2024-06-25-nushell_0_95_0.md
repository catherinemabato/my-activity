# Nushell 0.95.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->
Today, we're releasing version 0.95.0 of Nu. This release adds...

# Where to get it

Nu 0.95.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.95.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

## External command parsing improvements [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

A lot of the quirks of external command parsing have been cleaned up in [#13089](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13089), with most of the actual string handling work being moved into `nu-parser` itself. Previously, the parser was doing some very special things to create expressions in a way that `run-external` would then finish parsing in order to handle quotes in external options, globs, tilde expansion, etc., but this was error prone and did not have great test coverage.

Resolving this made it easier to find some of the edge cases that were not being handled, as well as making some syntax behave in a way that feels more consistent with the rest of Nushell:

- Bare word interpolation works for external command options, and otherwise embedded in other strings:
  ```nushell
  ^echo --foo=(2 + 2) # prints --foo=4
  ^echo -foo=$"(2 + 2)" # prints -foo=4
  ^echo foo="(2 + 2)" # prints (no interpolation!) foo=(2 + 2)
  ^echo foo,(2 + 2),bar # prints foo,4,bar
  ```

- Bare word interpolation expands for external command head/args:
  ```nushell
  let name = "exa"
  ~/.cargo/bin/($name) # this works, and expands the tilde
  ^$"~/.cargo/bin/($name)" # this doesn't expand the tilde
  ^echo ~/($name)/* # this glob is expanded
  ^echo $"~/($name)/*" # this isn't expanded
  ```

- Ndots are now supported for the head/args of an external command (`^.../foo` works, expanding to `^../../foo`)
    - Because our ndots handling requires path normalization, it is disabled for bare arguments that don't contain at least three consecutive dots, and for arguments that contain the string `://` as that is likely to be a URL.

- Glob values are now supported for head/args of an external command, and expanded appropriately:
  ```nushell
  ^("~/.cargo/bin/exa" | into glob) # the tilde is expanded
  ^echo ("*.txt" | into glob) # this glob is expanded
  ```

## Plugin version reporting [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

Plugins can now report their own version to Nushell, and have it displayed in `plugin list` and `version`. This can help users understand exactly which plugin version they have active in their shell.

This is a breaking change for the Rust API, as implementing it on the `Plugin` trait is now required. We recommend the following implementation, which will take the plugin version directly from the cargo package metadata:

```rust
fn version(&self) -> String {
    env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION").into()
}
```

If not using the Rust plugin API, you need to implement the new [`Metadata`](/contributor-book/plugin_protocol_reference.md#metadata-plugin-call) call. Providing a version is optional, but highly recommended.

### `run-external` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

`run-external` now works more like any other command, without expecting a special call convention for its args:

  ```nushell
  > run-external echo "'foo'"
  # 0.94: 'foo'
  # 0.95: foo
  > run-external echo "*.txt"
  # 0.94: (glob is expanded)
  # 0.95: *.txt
  ```

This argument handling is now implemented in the parser instead. [See the previous section](#external-command-parsing-improvements-toc) for more information on these changes.

## Bug fixes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

<!-- NOTE: to start investigating the contributions of last release, i like to list them all in a raw table.
    to achieve this, one can use the [`list-merged-prs` script from `nu_scripts`](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs)
    as follows:

    ```nushell
    use ./make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs
    use std clip

    let last_release_date = ^gh api /repos/nushell/nushell/releases
        | from json
        | into datetime published_at
        | get published_at
        | sort
        | last

    let prs = list-merged-prs nushell/nushell $last_release_date
        | sort-by mergedAt
        | update url {|it| $"[#($it.number)]\(($it.url)\)" }
        | update author { $"[@($in)]\(https://github.com/($in)\)" }
        | select author title url
        | rename -c {url: pr}
        | to md --pretty

    $prs | to md --pretty | clip
    ```

## Notes for plugin developers [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### API [[toc](#table-of-content)]

- The `Plugin` trait now has a required method `fn version(&self) -> String`. The following implementation should suffice in most cases:
    ```rust
    fn version(&self) -> String {
        env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION").into()
    }
    ```
- A new derive macro has been added ([#13031](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13031)) for `FromValue` and `IntoValue` conversion traits to make serialization to and from Nushell values easier. The API design is similar to `serde-derive`. We expect this to make certain kinds of plugins much easier to develop! Many thanks to [@cptpiepmatz](https://github.com/cptpiepmatz).

### Protocol [[toc](#table-of-content)]

- The plugin protocol has a new required call, [`Metadata`](/contributor-book/plugin_protocol_reference.md#metadata-plugin-call), which is currently used to report version information on registration, but may be used for other plugin metadata in the future. The intention is that all fields are optional, and `version` is currently optional. This means that although the Rust API requires a version to be reported, it is perfectly allowed (but not recommended) for a plugin to not report a version.

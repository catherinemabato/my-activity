# Nushell 0.95.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->
Today, we're releasing version 0.95.0 of Nu. This release adds...

# Where to get it

Nu 0.95.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.95.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Changes to commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## Additions [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## Breaking changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `path type` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

After [#13007](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13007), if the input path to `path type` is determined to not exist, `path type` will now return `null` instead of an empty string. In most cases, this should not require you to change your scripts. E.g., `("some/path" | path type) == dir` will still work as intended.

However, if the input path type was not able to be determined, `path type` will now create an error instead of silently returning an empty string. For example, invalid permissions for a path will now report an error:
```nushell
> '/root/test' | path type
Error: nu::shell::io_error

  × I/O error
   ╭─[entry #1:1:1]
 1 │ '/root/test' | path type
   · ──────┬─────
   ·       ╰── Permission denied (os error 13)
   ╰────
```

### `to toml` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@KAAtheWiseGit](https://github.com/KAAtheWiseGit) in [#13018](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13018), `to toml` will now output nushell date values as toml date values instead of as toml strings.

### `help commands` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

In the last release, changes were made to the `type` column for `scope commands` and `which`. However, the `command_type` column for `help commands` was missed, and this release makes its output/formatting consistent with the other two commands. In particular, `builtin` will now be reported as `built-in` ([#12996](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12996)).

### `str contains --not` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

[#13124](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13124) removes the `--not` flag on `str contains`. This flag was deprecated in the last release. You can check the [previous release notes](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2024-05-28-nushell_0_94_0.html#str-contains-not-toc) for migration examples.

### `sys` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Last release deprecated the `sys` command in favor of new subcommands. In this release, the deprecated output of `sys` has been removed, and `sys` will now only report the available subcommands ([#13114](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13114)).

## Deprecations [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `for --numbered` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@NotTheDr01ds](https://github.com/NotTheDr01ds) in [#13112](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13112), the obscure `--numbered` flag on `for` has been deprecated. Instead, please use the `enumerate` command.
```nushell
for x in ([bob fred] | enumerate) {
    print $'($x.index) is ($x.item)'
}
```

## Other changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### String command parse-time evaluation [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@Embers-of-the-Fire](https://github.com/Embers-of-the-Fire) in [#13032](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13032), many more string-related commands can now be run during parse-time (i.e., used with `const`). This includes:
- `str trim`
- `str contains`
- `str distance`
- `str ends-with`
- `str expand`
- `str index-of`
- `str join`
- `str replace`
- `str reverse`
- `str starts-with`
- `str stats`
- `str substring`
- `str capitalize`
- `str downcase`
- `str upcase`
- `split chars`
- `split column`
- `split list`
- `split row`
- `split words`
- `format date`
- `format duration`
- `format filesize`
- `parse`
- `detect columns`
- `encode`
- `decode`

### Range slice changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

In [#13113](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13113), `str substring` and `bytes at` were changed so that they no longer error if the end range index is greater than the start range index. Instead, an empty string or binary value will be returned. For example, this can happen if the end index is negative:
```nushell
"aaa" | str substring 2..-3
```

### `from toml` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@abusch](https://github.com/abusch) in [#13045](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13045), `from toml` will now preserve the order of keys/entries as they appear in the input.

### `into filesize` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@hqsz](https://github.com/hqsz) in [#12974](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12974), `into filesize` can now parse (more) strings that start with a plus sign.

## Bug fixes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `sys users` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@weirdan](https://github.com/weirdan) in [#13172](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13172), the signature of `sys users` has been fixed. It used to say that a record would be returned, but `sys users` actually returns a table.

### `into filesize` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@hqsz](https://github.com/hqsz) in [#13110](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13110), a bug due to integer casting was fixed for `into filesize`.

### `explore` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

[#13074](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13074) fixes a bug where `explore` would panic on an empty list.

<!-- NOTE: to start investigating the contributions of last release, i like to list them all in a raw table.
    to achieve this, one can use the [`list-merged-prs` script from `nu_scripts`](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs)
    as follows:

    ```nushell
    use ./make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs
    use std clip

    let last_release_date = ^gh api /repos/nushell/nushell/releases
        | from json
        | into datetime published_at
        | get published_at
        | sort
        | last

    let prs = list-merged-prs nushell/nushell $last_release_date
        | sort-by mergedAt
        | update url {|it| $"[#($it.number)]\(($it.url)\)" }
        | update author { $"[@($in)]\(https://github.com/($in)\)" }
        | select author title url
        | rename -c {url: pr}
        | to md --pretty

    $prs | to md --pretty | clip
    ```

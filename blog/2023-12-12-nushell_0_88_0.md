# Nushell 0.88.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->
Today, we're releasing version 0.88.0 of Nu. This release adds...

# Where to get it

Nu 0.88.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.88.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

::: tip Note
The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

## Spread operator

[#10598](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/10598) asked for a spread operator (`...`), and in [#11006](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11006)
and [#11144](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11144/), [@ysthakur](https://github.com/ysthakur/) implemented a spread operator in lists and records, respectively.
Spreading arguments to commands has not been implemented yet.

The spread operator can help you avoid `append` in lists, e.g., this:
```nushell
let list = ["foo"]
[
    1,
    ...$list,
    ...("foo" | split chars),
    ...[3 9],
    []
] | to nuon
```
will give:
```nushell
[1, foo, f, o, o, 3, 9, []]
```

In records, it can help you avoid `merge`, e.g., this:
```nushell
let record = { a: "foo" }
{
    ...$record,
    y: "bar",
    ...{ z: 2 }
} | to nuon
```
will give:
```nushell
{a: foo, y: bar, z: 2}
```

You can spread variables, subexpressions, and either lists (inside list literals) or records (inside record literals).
Note that there needs to be no whitespace between the `...` and the expression being spread.

## Our set of commands is evolving [[toc](#table-of-content)]
As usual, new release rhyms with changes to commands!

<!-- NOTE: to start investigating the contributions of last release, i like to list them all in a raw table.
    to achieve this, one can use the [`list-merged-prs` script from `nu_scripts`](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs)
    as follows:

    ```nushell
    use ./make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs
    use std clip

    let last_release_date = ^gh api /repos/nushell/nushell/releases
        | from json
        | into datetime published_at
        | get published_at
        | sort
        | last

    let prs = list-merged-prs nushell/nushell $last_release_date
        | where author != "app/dependabot"
        | sort-by mergedAt
        | update url {|it| $"[#($it.number)]\(($it.url)\)" }
        | update author { $"[@($in)]\(https://github.com/($in)\)" }
        | select author title url
        | rename -c {url: pr}
        | to md --pretty

    $prs | to md --pretty | clip
    ```

# Nushell 0.78

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.78 of Nu. This release adds ...

# Where to get it

Nu 0.78 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.78.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

NOTE: The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

## Optional cell path members ([rgwood](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8379))

In Nu 0.78, you can use `?` in cell paths to suppress errors from missing data. `?` is a more convenient+powerful version of the `-i`/`--ignore-errors` flag on `get` and `select`. Here are some examples:

```bash
{ foo: 123 }.bar # errors because `bar` is not present on the record
{ foo: 123 }.bar? # returns null

{ foo: 123 } | get bar # errors
{ foo: 123 } | get bar? # returns null

{ foo: 123 }.bar.baz # errors
{ foo: 123 }.bar.baz? # errors because `bar` is not present
{ foo: 123 }.bar?.baz # returns null even though `baz` is not present; `?` short-circuits
{ foo: 123 }.bar?.baz? # returns null

[1, 2, 3].8 # errors because there is no 8th item in the list
[1, 2, 3].8? # returns null

[{foo: 123}, {}].foo # errors because `foo` is not present on every item in the table
[{foo: 123}, {}].foo? # returns a list [123, null]
```

`?` works anywhere that cell paths work, including `where`:

```
> [{foo: 123}, {}] | where foo? == 123
╭───┬─────╮
│ # │ foo │
├───┼─────┤
│ 0 │ 123 │
╰───┴─────╯
```

## Examples results are now shown in `help` pages ([amtoine](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8189))

When commands define expected results for their examples, the output is now shown just below the associated examples.

Let's take the `merge` command as an example!

Before the change, the output of `help merge` would give

```bash
Examples:
  Add an 'index' column to the input table
  > [a b c] | wrap name | merge ( [1 2 3] | wrap index )

  Merge two records
  > {a: 1, b: 2} | merge {c: 3}

  Merge two tables, overwriting overlapping columns
  > [{columnA: A0 columnB: B0}] | merge [{columnA: 'A0*'}]
```

Now, it gives the output of all the example commands:

```bash
Examples:
  Add an 'index' column to the input table
  > [a b c] | wrap name | merge ( [1 2 3] | wrap index )
  ╭───┬──────╮
  │ # │ name │
  ├───┼──────┤
  │ 1 │ a    │
  │ 2 │ b    │
  │ 3 │ c    │
  ╰───┴──────╯

  Merge two records
  > {a: 1, b: 2} | merge {c: 3}
  ╭───┬───╮
  │ a │ 1 │
  │ b │ 2 │
  │ c │ 3 │
  ╰───┴───╯

  Merge two tables, overwriting overlapping columns
  > [{columnA: A0 columnB: B0}] | merge [{columnA: 'A0*'}]
  ╭───┬─────────┬─────────╮
  │ # │ columnA │ columnB │
  ├───┼─────────┼─────────┤
  │ 0 │ A0*     │ B0      │
  ╰───┴─────────┴─────────╯
```

# Breaking changes

## `||` now required in closures

PLACEHOLDER TEXT

This one is a big deal, it will break everyone's config. If we're going to keep this change we need to be loud and clear when telling people about it. We should mention it near the very top of the blog post.

#### Empty lists handled more consistently

- `[] | select foo` [now returns an empty list instead of `null`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8651)
- `sort`, `uniq`, `sort-by`, and `uniq-by` [now return empty lists when given an empty list](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8669) (previously they would throw an error)

These changes make it easier to work with lists of unknown size.

#### Comparison operators now allow null

Previously expressions like `1 < null` would error; [now they return `null`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8617).

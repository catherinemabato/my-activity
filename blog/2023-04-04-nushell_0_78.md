# Nushell 0.78

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.78 of Nu. This release adds pattern matching, speed improvements, easier cell paths when columns may be missing, better error handling, and much more.

# Where to get it

Nu 0.78 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.78.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

NOTE: The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Themes of this release / New features

## Reworked aliases (Breaking changes!) ([kubouch](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8123))

```bash
〉"7fffffffffffffff" | into int -r 16 | into datetime
Fri, 11 Apr 2262 23:47:16 +0000 (in 239 years)
〉("7fffffffffffffff" | into int -r 16) * -1 | into datetime
Tue, 21 Sep 1677 00:12:43 +0000 (345 years ago)
```

## Pattern matching (jt)

With 0.78, Nushell now comes with the `match` expression, which allows you to do pattern matching on a value. It supports a variety of different kinds of patterns, which can be mixed and matched to create more complicated patterns.

A simple example matching against a constant or a range:
```
match 3 {
  1 => { print "it's a 1" }
  1..10 => { print "it's between 1 and 10 }
}
```

Another example, this time matching against a record value, with a fall-through if it doesn't match:
```
match $a {
  {x: $x, y: 10} => { print $"y is 10 and x is: ($x)" }
  _ => { print "the above didn't match, so we print this instead" }
}
```

You can also match on the elements of a list:
```
match $list {
  [$one] => { print "one element list" }
  [$one, $two] => { print "two element list" }
  [$head, ..$tail] => print $"the tail of the list is ($tail)" }
}
```

## Speed improvements ([jt](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8609))

We've sped up the performance of tight loops like `for` and `while` considerably in this release. For example, on our test machine:

Example 1: `timeit { for x in 1..1000000 {} }`
- 0.77.1: 908ms
- 0.78.0: 52ms

Example 2: `timeit { mut x = 1; while $x < 1000000 { $x += 1 } }`
- 0.77.1: 1082ms
- 0.78.0: 170ms

## Optional cell path members ([rgwood](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8379))

In Nu 0.78, you can use `?` in cell paths to suppress errors from missing data. `?` is a more convenient+powerful version of the `-i`/`--ignore-errors` flag on `get` and `select`. Here are some examples:

```bash
{ foo: 123 }.bar # errors because `bar` is not present on the record
{ foo: 123 }.bar? # returns null

{ foo: 123 } | get bar # errors
{ foo: 123 } | get bar? # returns null

{ foo: 123 }.bar.baz # errors
{ foo: 123 }.bar.baz? # errors because `bar` is not present
{ foo: 123 }.bar?.baz # returns null even though `baz` is not present; `?` short-circuits
{ foo: 123 }.bar?.baz? # returns null

[1, 2, 3].8 # errors because there is no 8th item in the list
[1, 2, 3].8? # returns null

[{foo: 123}, {}].foo # errors because `foo` is not present on every item in the table
[{foo: 123}, {}].foo? # returns a list [123, null]
```

`?` works anywhere that cell paths work, including `where`:

```
> [{foo: 123}, {}] | where foo? == 123
╭───┬─────╮
│ # │ foo │
├───┼─────┤
│ 0 │ 123 │
╰───┴─────╯
```

## better error handling in `error make` (`amtoine` in [#8511](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8511) and [#8570](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8570))

The `error make` command now gives better hints about why the format is not a valid `error make` format:

- with an empty format, `error make {}` will say that there is a "_missing required member `$.msg`_"
- with an empty `$.label`, `error make {msg: "message", label: {}}` will say there is a "_missing required member `$.label.text`_"
- finally, when `$.label.start` / `$.label.end` is not defined while the other is, `error make` will give a hint as to add the missing one to the format!

The second change disallow the use of a `$.label.start` greater than `$.label.end` as a span.

## New `math exp` command ([lesves](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8700))

To complement the `math ln` command, we now include a `math exp` command for exponentiation with the base e.

# Breaking changes

## `||` now required in closures

To help differentiate between blocks (which can mutate variables) and closures (which can be used in a pipeline), we've changed the syntax of closures to require `||`. This means the simplest closure now looks like `{|| }`

This one is a big deal, as it will break everyone's config. If we're going to keep this change we need to be loud and clear when telling people about it. We should mention it near the very top of the blog post.

## We no longer automatically print values as part of a script

We've changed the automatic-printing rules for scripts and the REPL to now only automatically print the last value. This means two major breaking changes:

- We no longer [automatically print loop values](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8618)
- We no longer [print the results of every line automatically, requiring you to do it manually](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8292)

## Bare words can't start with a number

Words that start with a number or are in some way number-like must [now must be wrapped in backticks to be treated at a bare word or wrapped in quotes to be a string](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8635).

## Fields can only be defined once

You can no longer [redefine a field in a record during initialization](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8705)

## Thread configuration moves to `par-each`

Nushell no longer accepts the [-t/--threads flag to the binary as it's now part of `par-each`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8686)

## Ranges become the standard range specifier

`str substring` now [only accepts ranges](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8660) as does [`bytes at`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8710).

## Alias recursion has been disabled

Alias recursion is [now disabled](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8557)

## Empty lists handled more consistently

`[] | select foo` [now returns an empty list instead of `null`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8651) and `sort`, `uniq`, `sort-by`, and `uniq-by` [now return empty lists when given an empty list](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8669) (previously they would throw an error)

These changes make it easier to work with lists of unknown size.

## Comparison operators now allow null

Previously expressions like `1 < null` would error; [now they return `null`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8617).

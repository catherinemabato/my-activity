# Nushell 0.71

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your commandline. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful commandline pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.71 of Nu. This release includes lots of overall polish.

# Where to get it

Nu 0.71 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.71.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

If you want all the built-in goodies, such as support for dataframes and SQLite databases, you can install it via `cargo install nu --features=extra`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Themes of this release

## We introduce a new feature that renders the right prompt on the indicator line ([nibon7](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6781))

This feature is not enable by default, you can enable it using the `config nu` command to modify the config.nu file, just set `render_right_prompt_on_last_line` to true:

```
let-env config {
  render_right_prompt_on_last_line : true
  ...
}
```

# Breaking changes

- New `--force (-f)` flag for the `mv` command. This change alters `mv` default behavior and prevents overwritting existing file (You can use `alias mv = mv -f` in you config to get the old defaults back). ([#6904](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6904))


# Next Steps

We're continuing to work on language updates and hope to have more information for you soon. If you'd like to become part of the effort, please [join the discord](https://discord.gg/NtAbbGn).

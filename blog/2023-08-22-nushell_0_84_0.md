# Nushell 0.84.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.84.0 of Nu. This release adds...

<!-- more -->

# Where to get it

Nu 0.84.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.84.0.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

NOTE: The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Themes of this release / New features
## Shoutouts to the community
Since last release, some commands have changed, here is a list of some interesting changed
- [@jflics6460](https://github.com/jflics6460) in [#9771](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9771):   `http` commands now accept records as their `-H` argument
- [@ineu](https://github.com/ineu)             in [#10022](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10022): Adds an option to display the request headers in `http` commands
- [@atahabaki](https://github.com/atahabaki)   in [#9841](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9841), [#9856](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9856) and [#9940](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9940): Some refinement of the `str expand` command (it's a really cool command, i recommend you check it out :))
- [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred)       in [#9987](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9987):   Allow `select` to take a variable with a list of columns
- [@kubouch](https://github.com/kubouch)       in [#10038](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10038): `str replace` now matches substrings by default, i.e. the `--string` option is now the default, will be removed in the next release and `--regex` is a new option that should be used explicitely to get the previous behaviour as expected
- [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred)       in [#10048](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10048): Allow `int` as a *cellpath* for `select`

- [@kubouch](https://github.com/kubouch)       in [#10023](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10023), [#10039](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10039) and [#10045](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10045): The `scope` commands have been greatly refactored => if you use them in your scripts, you might want to check them out :)

> :bulb: **Note**  
> the change from []() on `str replace` above might (and will) break some of your scripts...  
> in order to fix them, one can run the following commands:
> ```nushell
> sd "str replace (.*) --string" "str FOO replace $1" **/*.nu
> sd "str replace" "str replace --regex" **/*.nu
> sd "str FOO replace" "str replace" **/*.nu
> ```
> or the following (not-tested) pure-Nushell pipeline
> ```nushell
> ls **/*.nu | each {|file|
>     open $file.name
>         | str replace --all --regex "str replace (.*) --string" "str FOO replace $1"
>         | str replace --all "str replace" "str replace --regex"
>         | str replace --all "str FOO replace" "str replace"
>         | save --force $file.name
> }
> ```

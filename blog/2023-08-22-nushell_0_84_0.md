# Nushell 0.84.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.84.0 of Nu. This release adds exporting constants from modules, `scope` commands improvements, cosmetic changes, and many smaller changes to our commands.

<!-- more -->

# Where to get it

Nu 0.84.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.84.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

NOTE: The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Themes of this release / New features

## (Major Breaking Change!) `str replace` matches substring by default ([kubouch](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10038))

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

`str replace` now matches a substring instead of a regular expression by default and the `-s`/`--string` flag is deprecated (will be removed altogether in 0.85). Matching a substring by default makes it more consistent with the rest of the Nushell's commands.

> :bulb: **Note!**
> Since `str replace` is a widely used command, many scripts are going to break. Fixing it is easy:
>
> - If you used `str replace` **without** the `-s`/`--string` flag, you used regex matching and you should add `--regex` flag to keep the previous functionality.
> - If you used `str replace` **with** the `-s`/`--string` flag, you will get a deprecation warning. To get rid of the warning, simply remove the flag.

## Constants from modules ([WindSoilder](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9773), [kubouch](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10049))

You can now use constants in modules and export them. Calling `use` on a module will create record containing all module's constants. You can also import the constants directly, for example with `use module.nu const-name`, without creating the module's record. Example:

```nushell
> module spam {
    export const X = 'x'
    export module eggs {
        export const Y = 'y'
        export const viking = 'eats'
    }
}

> use spam

> $spam
╭──────┬───────────────────╮
│ eggs │ {record 2 fields} │
│ X    │ x                 │
╰──────┴───────────────────╯

> $spam.eggs
╭────────┬──────╮
│ Y      │ y    │
│ viking │ eats │
╰────────┴──────╯

> use spam eggs viking

> $viking
eats
```

The exported values are true constants which means that you can use them in some scenarios where you cannot use normal variables, such as:

```nushell
> module files {
    export const MY_CONFIG = '/home/viking/.config/nushell/my_config.nu'
}

> use files MY_CONFIG

> source $MY_CONFIG  # sources '/home/viking/.config/nushell/my_config.nu'
```

## New options for more compact table display ([@zhiburt](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9983), [#9796](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9796))

To save screen space, you can now display tables with the header directly displayed on the border through the `$env.config.table.header_on_separator` option.

![Table with header displayed on border](../assets/images/0_84_table_compact.png)

Additionally you can now configure the `padding` left and right of the table cell content either separately or all at once to adjust the layout for your readability needs.

![Table with different padding options](../assets/images/0_84_table_padding.png)

## More consistent `format ...` commands ([@sholderbach](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9788), [@WindSoilder](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9902))

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

With this release we moved several commands that serve to produce string output from a particular data type as `format` subcommands.

1. `date format` has been renamed to `format date` ([#9788](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9788)).
2. `into duration --convert` was previously used to provide string representations of `duration`s. This option has been removed and you should now use `format duration`. ([#9902](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9902))
3. `format filesize` that was previously moved into the `--features extra` set is back in the core ([#9978](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9978)).

## `scope` commands enhancements ([kubouch](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10023), [kubouch](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10045))

`scope` commands received a significant amount of improvements making them more useful for advanced introspection of Nushell's definitions.

- `scope externs` now lists known externals (defined with `extern`)
- `scope aliases` is now fixed and lists names and usages of the aliases, not of the aliased commands (this used to cause some confusion)
- `scope modules` now lists all the exportable of the module, including submodules with their contents
- all `scope` commands now list the definition's ID which can be used for reliable tracking of definitions. For example, a command `foo` imported from a module `spam` using `use spam` will be named `spam foo`, therefore, relying solely on names of the definitions can sometimes be misleading.
- `module_name` field is no longer present
- `scope variables` now denotes whether a variable is a constant or not

## `http` commands now handle headers better ([@jflics6460](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9771), [@ineu](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10022)

You can now pass headers directly as a record to the `-H` flag.

```nushell
http get -H {cookie: "acc=foobar"} http://example.com
```

When running a `http` command with `--full` to get additional metadata about the response you can now get both the request and the response header

```nushell
http get --full -H {cooke: "my=cookie"} | get headers | get response
```

## Work on the optional dataframe features ([@ayax79](https://github.com/ayax79))

[@ayax79](https://github.com/ayax79) has been working hard to update our dataframe command to work again with the stricter type check by consolidating internal logic ([#9860](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9860),
[#9951](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9951)).

Furthermore, `dfr open` now supports the avro exchange format and a new `dfr to-avro` command was added in [#10019](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10019)

## Changes to other commands

Since last release, some commands have changed, here is a list of some interesting changed

- [@atahabaki](https://github.com/atahabaki) in [#9841](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9841), [#9856](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9856) and [#9940](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9940): Some refinement of the `str expand` command (it's a really cool command, i recommend you check it out :))
- [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) in [#9987](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9987): Allow `select` to take a variable with a list of columns
- [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) in [#10048](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10048): Allow `int` as a _cellpath_ for `select`

## Command organization ([@storm](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9926), [@sophiajt](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10051))

In our efforts towards stabilization we moved several commands either behind the `--features extra` build-flag or back into the core set of commands.
The special `str *-case` commands for example have been moved out of the core set, while the `bytes` commands to deal with bytes in arbitrary encodings have returned to the core set.
Furthermore all commands in the core set should now have helpful categories associated with them.

## Deprecation and removal of commands ([@amtoine](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9840), [@sholderbach](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10000))

We previously used the term "deprecation" pretty loosely to describe the removal of commands while emitting a helpful error. We intend to now start to use deprecation to warn you before the final removal of a particular option or command.
When we removed a command we will now properly refer to it as removal and started adding warnings where appropriate (e.g. `str replace --string`). As part of this update we removed some very old error helpers nudging you to upgrade to new commands.

## Documentation

Thanks to [@rgwood](https://github.com/rgwood), [@sholderbach](https://github.com/sholderbach),
[@kubouch](https://github.com/kubouch) and [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) the documentation
has become a bit better in [#9961](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9961),
[#9996](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9996), [#10004](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10004)
and [#10057](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10057).

## Notable bugfixes

- A panic when parsing the context of `let` assignments has been fixed ([@mengsuenyan](https://github.com/mengsuenyan) in [#9851](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9851))
- Invoking `--help` on a script with a `def main` command will now report the script's name instead of a more confusing `main` ([@sophiajt](https://github.com/sophiajt) in [#9948](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9948))
- Serious bugs in `parse` that produced incorrect output when given a long input stream have been fixed ([@panicbit](https://github.com/panicbit) in [#9925](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9925), [#9950](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9950))

# Breaking changes

- [#9902](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9902) `date format` has been renamed to `format date` for consistency.
- [#9788](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9788) The option `into duration --convert` to format durations has been removed. Use the `format duration` command instead.
- [#10038](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10038) `str replace` now by default matches to **strings** by default. If you want to use regexes you need to use the `-r` flag. The `--strings` flag has been removed
- [#9632](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9632) To be unambiguous the duration type now does not report months or years. The largest unit reported is weeks as they have a consistent length compared to months or years.
- [#9926](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9926) We moved some of the more exotic `str` case-commands behind the `--features extra` build-flag. This affects:
  - `str camel-case`
  - `str kebab-case`
  - `str pascal-case`
  - `str screaming-snake-case`
  - `str snake-case`
  - `str title-case`
- [#10053](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10053) make the charpage optional for `std clip`
- [#10023](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10023) The output of the `scope` commands has changed

### Internal breaking change only affecting plugin authors

- [#9927](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9927) Make `Value::columns` return slice instead of cloned Vec

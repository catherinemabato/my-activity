# Nushell 0.97.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->

Today, we're releasing version 0.97.0 of Nu. This release adds...

# Where to get it

Nu 0.97.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.97.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

    the following command should help pre-generate a great deal of the table of content.
    be careful with the format and false-positives :wink:
    ```nushell
    rg '^#+ ' blog/...
        | lines
        | each {
            str replace '# ' '- '
                | str replace --all '#' '    '

# Changes to commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## Additions [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `random binary` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@KAAtheWiseGit](https://github.com/KAAtheWiseGit) in [#13542](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13542), the `random binary` command was added. This command has one required parameter which is the number of bytes to generate.

```nushell
> random binary 16
Length: 16 (0x10) bytes | printable whitespace ascii_other non_ascii
00000000:   28 99 b7 0e  c0 2f 02 0c  d8 5a b9 69  72 36 86 30   (××•×/•_×Z×ir6×0
```

### `mv --update` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

In [#13505](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13505), [@Embers-of-the-Fire](https://github.com/Embers-of-the-Fire) added the `--update`/`-u` flag to `mv`. This has the same behavior/purpose as the `--update` flag on `cp`. Namely:

> move and overwrite only when the SOURCE file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missing

### `print --raw` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

In [#13597](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13597), the `--raw` flag was added to `print`. This will bypass any pretty formatting from `table` and instead write data directly to stdout or stderr.

### multipart/form-data [[toc](#table-of-content)]

In [#13532](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13532), thanks to [@weirdan](https://github.com/weirdan), the `http post` command now supports the `multipart/form-data` content type.

## Breaking changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `ps` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@qfel](https://github.com/qfel), after [#13618](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13618), the name column from the `ps` command will now contain the name of the process instead of its path.

### `ls` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

After [#13479](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/13479), the `--full-paths`/`-f` flag for `ls` will cause the paths in the `target` column to be fully qualified paths.

### `stor` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@maxim-uvarov](https://github.com/maxim-uvarov) in [#13464](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13464), `stor` no longer implicitly removes ansi escape sequences from strings that will be stored.

## Deprecations [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## Removals [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## Bug fixes and other changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### const math commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

In [#13566](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13566), [@Qnbie](https://github.com/Qnbie) has made more math commands usable in constant evaluation:

- `math abs`
- `math avg`
- `math ceil`
- `math floor`
- `math log`
- `math max`
- `math median`
- `math min`
- `math mode`
- `math product`
- `math round`
- `math stddev`
- `math sqrt` ([#13487](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13487))
- `math sum`
- `math variance`

### `glob` accepts globs [[toc](#table-of-content)]

After [#13612](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13612), `glob` now also takes globs (in addition to strings) as the first parameter.

### `into datetime` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@NotTheDr01ds](https://github.com/NotTheDr01ds) in [#13541](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13541), integer values can now be piped into `into datetime` in combination with a format string. The integers will be interpreted as nanosecond-precision UNIX timestamps.

### `reduce` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) in [#13461](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13461), the accumulator argument is now also passed as pipeline input to the closure provided to `reduce`.

### `split words` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@weirdan](https://github.com/weirdan) in [#13502](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13502), `split words` no longer removes digits and instead treats them as part of a word.

### `query web` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@Embers-of-the-Fire](https://github.com/Embers-of-the-Fire), some potential panics for `query web` were fixed in [#13507](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13507).

Additionally, thanks to [@jameschensmith](https://github.com/jameschensmith) in [#13538](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13538), an issue with values appearing in the wrong column due to missing data was fixed.

<!-- NOTE: to start investigating the contributions of last release, i like to list them all in a raw table.
    to achieve this, one can use the [`list-merged-prs` script from `nu_scripts`](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs)
    as follows:

    ```nushell
    use ./make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs
    use std clip

    let last_release_date = ^gh api /repos/nushell/nushell/releases
        | from json
        | into datetime published_at
        | get published_at
        | sort
        | last

    let prs = list-merged-prs nushell/nushell $last_release_date
        | sort-by mergedAt
        | update url {|it| $"[#($it.number)]\(($it.url)\)" }
        | update author { $"[@($in)]\(https://github.com/($in)\)" }
        | select author title url
        | rename -c {url: pr}
        | to md --pretty

    $prs | to md --pretty | clip
    ```
-->

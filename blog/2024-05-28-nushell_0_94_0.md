# Nushell 0.94.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->
Today, we're releasing version 0.94.0 of Nu. This release adds...

# Where to get it

Nu 0.94.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.94.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

## Fixing path and CWD handling [[toc](#table-of-content)]

One of our contributors, [@YizhePKU](https://github.com/YizhePKU), has started an effort to refactor how Nushell internally handles the current working directory and paths in general. Namely, Nushell aggressively canonicalizes paths instead of using logical paths which can lead to unintuitive or annoying behavior ([#2175](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/2175)). Thanks to their work, `$env.CWD` and the `pwd` now support logical paths. With time, we intend to make similar to changes to other commands to make them more intuitive and consistent with the rest of Nushell. Another goal with these changes is to eliminate bugs in commands, as some commands incorrectly use the Nushell process's current working directory instead of `$env.CWD`. So far, the `grid`, `path type`, and `touch --reference` commands have been fixed, and we are aiming to bring more fixes in the next release. We kindly ask for your patience as we rework this part of Nushell, and we would appreciate if you would report any issues you encounter!

## Case-preserving environment [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

In an effort to allow more ergonomic cross-platform scripting, we have changed the environment in Nushell to be case-preserving ([#12701](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12701)). That is, environment variables keep their initial casing but can be accessed in a case-insensitive manner within Nushell. This means that accessing `$env.PATH` or `$env.Path` will now work on both unix-based systems and Windows systems. To get environment variables in a case-sensitive manner, you can use `get -s`.
```nushell
$env | get -s PATH
```
Please note that there are still a few things that have to be ironed out with this new behavior. For example, it is currently unclear what `load-env { FOO: BAR, foo: bar }` should do. So, there may be more changes in the near future.

## Streaming all the things [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Another major effort with this release was to make streaming more consistent and widespread ([#12774](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12774), [#12897](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12897), [#12918](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12918), and more). For example, Nushell now passes operating system pipe descriptors directly to external commands, meaning there should be an improvement to throughput for some pipelines. Additionally, several commands were reworked so that they are now able to stream their output in more cases instead of having to collect it all in memory beforehand. The commands in question include `from csv`, `to csv`, `from tsv`, `to tsv`, `from json --objects`, `take`, `skip`, `first`, `last`, `bytes ends-with`, `bytes collect`, `str join`, `into string`, and `into binary`. Of course, the plan is to add more commands to this list in the future, so this is only the beginning!

## New language feature: raw strings [[toc](#table-of-content)]

This release adds a new type of string literal to the language: raw strings ([#9956](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9956)). These are just like single quoted strings, except that raw strings may also contain single quotes. This is possible, since raw strings are enclosed by a starting `r#'` and an ending `'#`. This syntax should look familiar to users of Rust.
```nushell
r#'some text'# == 'some text' # true

r#'contains 'quoted' text'# == "contains 'quoted' text"
```
Additional `#` symbols can be added to the start and end of the raw string to enclose one less than the same number of `#` symbols next to a `'` symbol in the string.
```nushell
r###'this text has multiple '## symbols'###
```

## Removal of deprecated features [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

Last release, we deprecated the dataframe commands and feature in favor of the new polars plugin. See the [previous release notes](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2024-04-30-nushell_0_93_0.html#introduction-of-the-polars-plugin-toc) for more information and migration steps. In this release, the dataframe commands have been removed as planned alongside the `dataframes` cargo feature. Similarly, this release removes lazy records from the language following their deprecation. This includes the removal of the `lazy make` command and the `--collect-lazyrecords` flag on `describe`. One consequence of this change is that the `sys` command will now return a regular record and will take a minimum of 400ms to complete (to sample CPU usage). As such, the `sys` command has been deprecated, and new subcommands have been added in its place (`sys mem`, `sys cpu`, `sys host`, `sys disks`, `sys net`, `sys temps`, and `sys users`).

<!-- NOTE: to start investigating the contributions of last release, i like to list them all in a raw table.
    to achieve this, one can use the [`list-merged-prs` script from `nu_scripts`](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs)
    as follows:

    ```nushell
    use ./make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs
    use std clip

    let last_release_date = ^gh api /repos/nushell/nushell/releases
        | from json
        | into datetime published_at
        | get published_at
        | sort
        | last

    let prs = list-merged-prs nushell/nushell $last_release_date
        | where author != "app/dependabot"
        | sort-by mergedAt
        | update url {|it| $"[#($it.number)]\(($it.url)\)" }
        | update author { $"[@($in)]\(https://github.com/($in)\)" }
        | select author title url
        | rename -c {url: pr}
        | to md --pretty

    $prs | to md --pretty | clip
    ```

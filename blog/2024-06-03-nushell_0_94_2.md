# Nushell 0.94.2

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.94.2 of Nu. This is a patch release to fix issues introduced by 0.94.0 and 0.94.1, namely backslash expansions of external commands and paths handling in globs.

# Where to get it

Nu 0.94.2 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.94.2) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Highlights and themes of this release [[toc](#table-of-content)]

This patch release contains two fixes:

## Fix external command name parsing with backslashes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

After the last release, external commands on Windows would incorrectly interpret backslashes in their path as escape sequences despite being unquoted, for example:
```
alias curl = c:\msys64\clangarm64\bin\curl.exe
               ───────────────┬──────────────
                              ╰── unrecognized escape after '\' in string
```

This is now fixed by [#13027](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13027) and externals should work correctly.

## Preserving absolute paths when expanding globs [[toc](#table-of-content)]

[#13028](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13028) fixes a bug when an unquoted tilde wasn't expanded properly to the home directory when being a subject of globbing.

## Known Bug [#13020](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/13020) [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Currently, we have one more known regression after 0.94.0, where attempting to run a PowerShell script on Windows using `.\script.ps1` would result in an error instead of opening an editor with the said file or running the script. We are still looking into this one, but it seems more tricky to resolve, so we decided to release at least the above two bugfixes.

The workaround for this problem is to spawn the file with PowerShell manually, such as `pwsh -f script.ps1` or `powershell.exe -f script.ps1`.

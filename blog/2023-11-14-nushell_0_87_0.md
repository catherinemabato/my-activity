# Nushell 0.87.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->

Today, we're releasing version 0.87.0 of Nu. This release focussed heavily on improving internals, fills a few gaps in our command set and completion handling, and starts work on an integrated LSP language server.

# Where to get it

Nu 0.87.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.87.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

::: tip Note
The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.
:::

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

## LSP is coming to Nushell [[toc](#table-of-content)]

IDE support has been and still is one of the big goals for Nushell 1.0: a modern language needs
to have proper language support to unlock pleasant and fast development with it :smile:

In [#10990](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10990), [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred)
made the shell integration with VS Code better.

::: warning
The rest of this section is in the early stages of its development.
It will require time to mature and be fully featured, but we're happy to ship it with Nushell as of
now.
:::

Thanks to [@schrieveslaach](https://github.com/schrieveslaach) and [#10723](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10723),
LSP is now coming to Nushell!

As Cargo comes with Rust, we want Nushell to embed its language support one way or another. The goal
is to make `nu` fully featured and capable of handling LSP, formatting, and testing without any extra
installation by default.

[#10723](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10723) integrates a Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation
directly inside Nushell. Running

```nushell
nu --lsp
```

will start the language server.

When properly configured in an IDE, the server can be run and then a client can attach to it and
query things like diagnostics, completions, and more in the future.

A very incomplete example, just to give you an idea, could be the following to setup `nu --lsp` as a
language server in Neovim:

```rust
configs.nulsp = {
    default_config = {
        cmd = { "nu", "--lsp" },
        filetypes = { "nu" },
        root_dir = function(fname)
            ...
        end
    },
}
```

## Living in the terminal: completions and hints [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@lavafroth](https://github.com/lavafroth) in [#10898](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10898)
Nushell will now fall back to the builtin default completer when external completers are defined but
return no results for the current command.

::: tip Note
The following example is fictitious, `carapace-bin` should be able to complete it :wink:
:::

Let's say you have [Carapace](https://rsteube.github.io/carapace/) setup as an
[external completer](https://www.nushell.sh/cookbook/external_completers.html#carapace-completer) but
it is not able to autocomplete `git comm<TAB>`, then Nushell will try to do it.

Because _most commands make sense only in the directory they were run in_, [@p00f](https://github.com/p00f)
wrote [#10780](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10780) which will make hints aware of the
current directory.

::: tip Note
Hints are the shadowed incomplete completions that appear when you start typing commands, e.g. if
you were to run `echo foo bar baz`, pressing `echo` would then show `foo bar baz` in a dimmed font:
this is a hint.
:::

## Handling exotic paths [[toc](#table-of-content)]

As can be seen in [#10571](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/10571)
, [#10364](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/10364) , [#10211](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/10211)
, [#9558](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/9558), [#9310](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/9310)
and probably more related issues and duplicates, handling _exotic_ filenames and filesystem paths, e.g.
containing _globbing_ characters or looking like command options, is a non-trivial problem to solve.

As part of this new release, [@lavafroth](https://github.com/lavafroth) and
[@bobhy](https://github.com/bobhy) have worked in the direction of making this experience better in
Nushell:

- files that look like command options, i.e. starting with `-` or `--` will be correctly escaped in completions with [#10721](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10721)
- with [#10694](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10694) commands such as `cp`, `rm`, or `mv`
  will first look at files from the input paths as the literal string and then, only if the literal file
  does not exist, they will expand the _globbing_ and work on the resulting found files

e.g. let's say I created a bunch of files, one of them containing an obvious _globbing_ pattern

```nushell
touch *.txt foo.txt bar.txt baz.txt
```

- running `rm *.txt` once will only remove `*.txt` and leave the three `{foo,bar,baz}.txt` files
- running `rm *.txt` a second time will remove all the other files

::: tip
The first time `*.txt` is interpreted as a literal and the `*.txt` file is found and removed.
The second time `*.txt` is not found as a literal filename. `rm` searches for `*.txt` as a _glob_
pattern; finds `foo.txt`, `bar.txt`, and `baz.txt`; and removes them.
:::

## Improving the `match` command [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Can we all agree for one moment that `match` is a great command?

```nushell
def work-on-list []: any -> string {
    match $in {
        [$x, ..] if $x == 1 => { 'good list' },
        [..] => { 'not a very good list' },
        _ => { 'not a list at all' }
    }
}
```

```nushell
> [1, 2, 3] | work-on-list
good list
> [2, 1, 3] | work-on-list
not a very good list
> "ehe i'm not a list" | work-on-list
not a list at all
```

However, it had a pretty big flaw: it was not able to work on `null` values :open_mouth:

```nushell
> match null { null => "success", _ => "failure" }
failure
```

In [#10829](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10829), thanks to [@hudclark](https://github.com/hudclark),
the `match` command is now able to work properly on `null` values.

```nushell
> match null { null => "success", _ => "failure" }
success
```

## Pipeline redirections [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Once again [@WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder) has been working on _pipeline redirections_.
Because they need to be given a target path to properly function, i.e.

```nushell
echo aaa o> | ignore
```

does not make sense in itself, [#10835](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10835) makes commands
such as the one just above throw a nice error:

```nushell
Error: nu::parser::parse_mismatch

  × Parse mismatch during operation.
   ╭─[entry #1:1:1]
 1 │ echo aaa o> | ignore
   ·          ─┬
   ·           ╰── expected redirection target
   ╰────
```

The following will still function as expected:

```nushell
echo aaa o> foo.txt | ignore
```

## Some work on the standard library [[toc](#table-of-content)]

[@amtoine](https://github.com/amtoine) made the use of `std 'path add'` better in [#10710](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10710).
Now this command that allows adding paths to the `$env.PATH` environment variable will (1) expand all
the input paths to get only absolute paths and (2) split `$env.PATH` on `:` to make sure the command runs
properly the first time it runs in the configuration.
::: tip Note
If Bash is still your login shell, the value of `$env.PATH` in `env.nu` might be a `:`-separated list of
system paths.
This change to `std 'path add'` should help prevent the final `$env.PATH` from containing this original
`:`-separated list of paths.
:::

A new candidate to the standard library, [`null-stream`](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/stdlib-candidate/null-stream.nu),
has been added by [@Hullabaloo-and-Howdy-Do](https://github.com/Hullabaloo-and-Howdy-Do) in [nushell/nu_scripts#649](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/pull/649)

## New allowed operands to the modulo operator [[toc](#table-of-content)]

When doing maths, _modulo_ is a ubiquitous operator, e.g.

```nushell
> (11 + 5) mod 7
2
```

```nushell
> (123 * 456) mod 13
6
```

However, this operation was only possible on `int` and `float` values.
As durations are so similar to integers and real numbers, i.e. they are just numbers with a simple
unit, [@gaetschwartz](https://github.com/gaetschwartz) implemented the `mod` operator of Nushell
for `duration`s in [#10745](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10745).

Thanks to their work, Nushell will now allow the following command:

```nushell
> (2min + 31sec) mod 20sec
11sec
```

## Disallowing invalid table definitions and manipulations [[toc](#table-of-content)]

As can be seen in [#11020](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/11020) and [#10875](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10875),
Nushell will let you define or manipulate tables that have columns called the same.
Starting the effort to fix these unexpected and error-prone behaviors, [@sholderbach](https://github.com/sholderbach)
disallowed the definition of table literals with duplicated columns in [#10875](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10875).

Trying to define the following ill-defined table

```nushell
[[a a]; [1 2]]
```

will result in an error from now onwards.

```nushell
Error: nu::shell::column_defined_twice

  × Record field or table column used twice
   ╭─[entry #2:1:1]
 1 │ [[a a]; [1 2]]
   ·   ┬ ┬
   ·   │ ╰── field redefined here
   ·   ╰── field first defined here
   ╰────
```

## The documentation becomes better [[toc](#table-of-content)]

This section sheds some light on some of the contributions from
[_Enhancing the documentation_](#enhancing-the-documentation-toc).

- [@drbrain](https://github.com/drbrain) in [#10952](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10952) made plugins show their extra usage and search terms in `--help`

```nushell
PluginSignature test 1 for plugin. Returns Value::Nothing

Extra usage for nu-example-1

Search terms: example

Usage:
  > nu-example-1 {flags} <a> <b> (opt) ...(rest)

Flags:
  -h, --help - Display the help message for this command
  -f, --flag - a flag for the signature
  -n, --named <String> - named string

Parameters:
  a <int>: required integer value
  b <string>: required string value
  opt <int>: Optional number (optional)
  ...rest <string>: rest value string

Examples:
  running example with an int value and string value
  > nu-example-1 3 bb
```

## Some progress in the "dataframe" department [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks again to [@ayax79](https://github.com/ayax79) who has been working on the dataframes.

- dataframes will now support small int types with [#10828](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10828)
- with [#10943](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10943), dataframes will now be able to read
  _Polars structs_, such as JSONL or PARQUET files that contain rows with structured data

## Our set of commands is evolving [[toc](#table-of-content)]

As usual, new release rhymes with changes to commands!

### New commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

- `whoami` using _uutils_ by [@tertsdiepraam](https://github.com/tertsdiepraam) in [#10488](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10488)
- `umkdir` using _uutils_ by [@KAAtheWiseGit](https://github.com/KAAtheWiseGit) in [#10785](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10785)
  - In an upcoming release we intend to replace our existing `mkdir` command with this [uutils implementation](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils)
- `exec` for Windows by [@IanManske](https://github.com/IanManske) in [#11001](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11001)

### Changes to existing commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

- the `ansi link` command has been put back to the default set of commands of Nushell by [@hustcer](https://github.com/hustcer) in [#10801](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10801). It should be available without any extra steps with this release.
- [@Tiggax](https://github.com/Tiggax) added `--ignore-error` to `reject` [#10737](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10737)
- in [#10795](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10795) [@gaetschwartz](https://github.com/gaetschwartz) added a `--detailed` option to `describe`
- `--update` has been added back to `cp` by [@ludwig-austermann](https://github.com/ludwig-austermann) in [#10824](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10824)
- empty lists are now allowed as input to `group-by` and will return an empty record thanks to [@0scvr](https://github.com/0scvr) in [#10730](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10730)
- [@CAD97](https://github.com/CAD97) has improved the return types of `registry value` in [#10806](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10806)
- [@gaetschwartz](https://github.com/gaetschwartz) has made the `debug info` command lazy in [#10728](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10728)
- `group-by` now returns a table instead of a record if you pass it the new flag `--to-table` thanks to [@drbrain](https://github.com/drbrain) and [#10848](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10848).
- with the changes from [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) in [#10870](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10870) and [#10912](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10912), `sort-by` is now allowed to work with records and `compact` with empty strings
- `input list` will now return `null` when no choice has been selected, see the contribution of [@KAAtheWiseGit](https://github.com/KAAtheWiseGit) in [#10913](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10913)
- thanks to [@KAAtheWiseGit](https://github.com/KAAtheWiseGit) `error make` has been refactored in [#10923](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10923) and will now take a `$.label.span` and a `$.help`

```nushell
error make {
    msg: "Message"
    label: {
        text: "Label text"
        span: (metadata $var).span
    }
}
```

- with [#11013](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11013) and thanks to [@sholderbach](https://github.com/sholderbach) `transpose` has been refactored and should now be much faster
- in [#11024](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11024) [@WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder) allowed `reject` to take lists as selector values
- the `--pretty` option has been removed from `to xml` in favor of `--indent` by [@Hofer-Julian](https://github.com/Hofer-Julian) in [#10668](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10668)

### Deprecated commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

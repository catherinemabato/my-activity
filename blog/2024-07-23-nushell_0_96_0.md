# Nushell 0.96.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->

Today, we're releasing version 0.96.0 of Nu. This release adds...

# Where to get it

Nu 0.96.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.96.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

    the following command should help pre-generate a great deal of the table of content.
    be careful with the format and false-positives :wink:

# Changes to commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## Additions [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `str deunicode` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

This release adds the `str deunicode` command which will convert unicode characters in a string to ASCII characters ([#13270](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13270)).

```nushell
> "A…B" | str deunicode
A...B
```

### `chunks` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The `group` command has been deprecated in favor of the new `chunks` command in [#13377](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13377). The hope is that the name "chunks" is more descriptive or intuitive compared to "group" so that users can more easily find the command they are looking for. `chunks` behaves exactly like `group` except that it will error if provided a chunk size of zero.

### `watch --quiet` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13415

Thanks to [@Zoybean](https://github.com/Zoybean) in [#13415](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13415), the `watch` command now has a `--quiet` flag which will prevent the initial watch message from being shown.

### `char nul` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@weirdan](https://github.com/weirdan) in [#13241](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13241), the NUL character (0x0) is now available via `char nul`, `char null_byte`, or `char zero_byte`.

## Breaking changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `generate` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

To support default closure parameters, the argument order for `generate` has been reversed. Instead of the initial value followed by the closure, `generate` now takes a closure followed by an initial value ([#13393](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13393)).

For example, using a closure with a default parameter:

```nushell
> generate {|fib=[0, 1]| { out: $fib.0, next: [$fib.1, ($fib.0 + $fib.1)] } } | skip 2 | take 6
╭───┬────╮
│ 0 │  1 │
│ 1 │  2 │
│ 2 │  3 │
│ 3 │  5 │
│ 4 │  8 │
│ 5 │ 13 │
╰───┴────╯
```

### Default column numbering [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The naming for default columns in `from csv`, `from tsv`, and `from ssv` was changed from 1-based indexing to 0-based indexing in [#13209](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13209) thanks to [@ito-hiroki](https://github.com/ito-hiroki). I.e., instead of:

```nushell
> "foo,bar,baz" | from csv -n
╭───┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────╮
│ # │ column1 │ column2 │ column3 │
├───┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┤
│ 0 │ foo     │ bar     │ baz     │
╰───┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────╯
```

the columns will now be named:

```nushell
> "foo,bar,baz" | from csv -n
╭───┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────╮
│ # │ column0 │ column1 │ column2 │
├───┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┤
│ 0 │ foo     │ bar     │ baz     │
╰───┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────╯
```

### `select` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

When providing cell paths with multiple members (e.g., `outer.inner`), the `select` command would name the output column by concatenating each cell path member with an underscore (e.g., `outer_inner`). After [#13361](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13361), instead of an underscore, a period will be used to concatenate the cell path members (e.g., `outer.inner`).

Before:

```nushell
> { a: { b: 1 } } | select a.b
╭─────┬───╮
│ a_b │ 1 │
╰─────┴───╯
```

After:

```nushell
> { a: { b: 1 } } | select a.b
╭─────┬───╮
│ a.b │ 1 │
╰─────┴───╯
```

### `std path add` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

To be less surprising, [@t-mart](https://github.com/t-mart) made the `std path add` function no longer resolve symlinks in either the newly added paths, nor expand paths already in the variable ([#13258](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13258)). To mimic the previous resolving behavior, you can use `path expand`:

```nushell
std path add ("foo/bar" | path expand)
```

### `default` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Previously, when given a list as input, the `default` command would replace `null` values inside of the list with the default value. This made it impossible to keep input lists intact while also replacing input nulls with a default value. I.e., the transformation from `null | list<null | string>` to `list<null | string>` is now possible after [#13386](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13386) thanks to [@weirdan](https://github.com/weirdan).

To replace nulls in a list with a default value, you can now use `each` instead:

```nushell
[null, "a", null] | each { default "b" } # [b a b]
```

### `window` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

With [#13401](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13401), the `window` command will now error if the provided window size is zero. Similarly, `window` will also error if `--stride` is zero.

### `break` and `continue` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

After [#13398](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13398), `break` and `continue` are no longer allowed inside the `each` and `items` commands. This means `break` and `continue` are now only allowed inside loops (`for`, `while`, and `loop`).

## Deprecations [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `group` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

See the notes for the new [`chunks` command](#chunks-toc) above.

## Removals [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `register` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The long deprecated `register` command has been finally removed in [#13297](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13297). Instead, please use the `plugin add` command. For more information, see the [release notes for 0.93.0](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2024-04-30-nushell_0_93_0.html#redesigned-plugin-management-commands-toc).

### `for --numbered` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The `--numbered` flag on `for` has been removed in [#13239](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13239) following its deprecation in the last release. See the [previous release notes](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2024-06-25-nushell_0_95_0.html#for-numbered-toc) for more information.

## Other changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `http` commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The data provided to the `http` family of commands (`post`, `put`, `patch`, `delete`) could previously only be supplied as a positional argument. But after [#13254](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13254), these commands now support taking data as pipeline input. This also means that these commands can now stream the input data over the network!

```nushell
# non-streaming version, content-type is automatically set
open test.json | http post https://httpbin.org/post

# streaming version, content-type needs to be set manually
open --raw test.json | http post -t application/json https://httpbin.org/post
```

### `metadata set --content-type` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

To implement automatic content-type detection, a new metadata field, the `content-type`, was added to pipeline outputs in [#13284](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13284). This field can be manually set using `metadata set` with the `--content-type` flag. Using this, we could have rewritten the streaming `http post` example above as:

```nushell
open --raw test.json
| metadata set --content-type application/json
| http post https://httpbin.org/post
```

### `to json` [[toc](#table-of-content)] [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@drmason13](https://github.com/drmason13) in [#133523](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13352), `to json` now places braces on the same line instead of on a new line.

### `into bits` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

With [#13310](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13310), `into bits` now streams its output if provided a streaming input.

## Bug fixes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `find` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@suimong](https://github.com/suimong) in [#13246](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13246), the `find` command now preserves the casing of its input. Before, it would output only lower cased text.

### `detect columns --guess` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

`detect columns --guess` would sometimes panic when handling multi-byte unicode characters. This has been fixed in [#13272](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13272) thanks to [@alex-tdrn](https://github.com/alex-tdrn).

### `do` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The signature of the `do` command has been fixed in [#13216](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13216) thanks to [@NotTheDr01ds](https://github.com/NotTheDr01ds). The first parameter is now correctly typed as a `closure` instead of `any`, and this should allow for
better compile-time checks/safety.

### `into datetime` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@hqsz](https://github.com/hqsz) in [#13289](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13289), `into datetime` can now take date strings without a timezone in combination with the `--format` flag.

### `from toml` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@ito-hiroki](https://github.com/ito-hiroki) in [#13315](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13315), `from toml` now correctly handles toml date values in more cases.

### `help operators` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

With [#13307](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13307), the output of `help operators` has been updated and fixed. Some of precedence values were previously out of date.

### `into binary` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

In [#13305](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13305), an issue has been fixed where external command output would still be treated as raw bytes after being passed through `into binary`.

### `take until` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The input/output types were edited in [#13356](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13356) to prevent type checking false positives.

<!-- NOTE: to start investigating the contributions of last release, i like to list them all in a raw table.
    to achieve this, one can use the [`list-merged-prs` script from `nu_scripts`](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs)
    as follows:

    ```nushell
    use ./make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs
    use std clip

    let last_release_date = ^gh api /repos/nushell/nushell/releases
        | from json
        | into datetime published_at
        | get published_at
        | sort
        | last

    let prs = list-merged-prs nushell/nushell $last_release_date
        | sort-by mergedAt
        | update url {|it| $"[#($it.number)]\(($it.url)\)" }
        | update author { $"[@($in)]\(https://github.com/($in)\)" }
        | select author title url
        | rename -c {url: pr}
        | to md --pretty

    $prs | to md --pretty | clip

excerpt: Today, we're releasing patch version 0.84.2 of Nu. This hot-fix release aims at fixing annoying issues introducing by 0.83.0.
---

A few days ago, the [`0.83` version of Nushell][Nushell 0.83] has been released. As you can see in
the [release notes][Nushell 0.83 notes], the major axis of this new version have been
- the addition of input / output type annotation and check, see [this section][input/output types]
  for more details
- [breaking changes] such as the removal of the `let-env` command in favor of `$env.FOO = ...`

Extensive efforts have been made before the release to mitigate the bugs introduced by these two
points
- quite a lot of command signatures have been updated to keep functionalities to the same level
  while adding better type checking
- major integration scripts from 3rd-party applications have been fixed prior to the release

However, as you might have noticed and thanks to the feedback of you the community, more issues and
bugs have been found, all related to the two points above.
This is too inconvenient to keep for 4 weeks straight, so a project for a *patch release* started
in [*Tracking issue for 0.83.0 fixup* #9812][#9812] and the version `0.83.2` has been released!

## What does this new *hot-fix release* address?
Most of the *type-system*-related issues have been fixed, hopefully bringing most of the command
set of Nushell back to its previous feature level with the nice addition of better input / output
type checking and annotations.

## What will this new *hot-fix release* NOT address?
Bring the `let-env` command back to life.

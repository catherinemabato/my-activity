# Nushell 0.79

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.79 of Nu. This release adds a standard library written in nu itself.

# Where to get it

Nu 0.79 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.79.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

NOTE: The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Themes of this release / New features

## Relaxed parsing rules (jt)

We listened to your feedback around the syntax changes introduced with 0.78 and decided to revert to the old behavior around the parsing rules for numeric literals as well as the compulsory `||` for closures.

## Standard library ([@amtoine, @presidento, @bobhy, @fdncred, ...][stdlib PRs])

This is it. We finally release the standard library with this `0.79`!
It's been on the mind of the core team of Nushell for some time and it was made real between the two releases.

But first of all... **what is the _standard library_?**

The nushell standard library is a **collection of nushell scripts** that are **automatically loaded** in the nushell binary
and **reachable via the `use` command** without any additional setup.

The goal of this library is, as its name suggests, to provide a _standard_ experience and a _standardized_ set of commands and tools to any Nushell user.
In `std`, one can find things like

- a test framework to write robust Nushell scripts, modules and libraries
- implementation of builtin commands once written in `rust`
- logging commands with several log levels
- ...

> :bulb: **Note**  
> yes, you heard right, in the future, the standard library might become a sanctuary for non-time-critical commands that were once written in `rust`
> as part of the built-in set of commands!
>
> Right now, we are actively trying to move the `help` commands from the `nushell` core implementation to the library.

With this release, the library comes with the following custom commands:
| module | description | commands |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`std assert`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-std/lib/testing.nu) | a set of commands to write tests | assert, assert, equal, assert, error, assert, greater, assert, greater, or, equal, assert, length, assert, less, assert, less, or, equal, assert, not, equal, assert, skip, assert, str, contains |
| [`std dirs`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-std/lib/dirs.nu) | a re-implementation of the `shells` commands | dirs, add, dirs, drop, dirs, next, dirs, prev, dirs, show |
| [`std help`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-std/lib/help.nu) | a Nushell implementation of the built-in commands | help, help, aliases, help, commands, help, externs, help, modules, help, operators |
| [`std iter`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-std/lib/iter.nu) | an extension of built-in commands to iterate over data | iter, filter-map, iter, find, iter, intersperse, iter, scan |
| [`std log`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-std/lib/log.nu) | never miss something in your scripts | log, critical, log, debug, log, error, log, info, log, warning |
| [`xml` module](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-std/lib/xml.nu) | tools to interact with Xml data | xaccess, xinsert, xtype, xupdate |

### TL;DR

As there has been quite a lot of contributions already (see the [50 closed PRs][stdlib PRs] at the time i'm writing this :o),
i'm just gonna give some hints and links in this release note, leaving the rest to the amazing work of other contributors who wrote parts of the lib and its documents (shout out to
[@presidento](https://github.com/presidento),
[@bobhy](https://github.com/bobhy) and
[@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred):

- the library can be used and tested with

```nushell
use std  # will load the whole library under the `std` namespace
```

or

```nushell
use std ...
```

- one can follow the activity of the library in the [roadmap](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/8450)
- the library comes with a test framework; see the [_Testing your Nushell code_](https://www.nushell.sh/book/testing.html) chapter of the book
- the long term information, changelog and updates shall be found in the [_Standard library_](https://www.nushell.sh/book/standard_library.html) chapter of the Nushell book
- if you are a contributor willing to help out, everything happens in the [`nu-std` crate](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/tree/main/crates/nu-std), especially the
  [`CONTRIBUTING.md` document](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-std/CONTRIBUTING.md) which explains all there is to know about "_developing with `std`_"
  in great details.

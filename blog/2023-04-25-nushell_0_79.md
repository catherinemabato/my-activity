# Nushell 0.79

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.79 of Nu. This release adds a standard library written in nu itself and enhanced IDE support.

<!-- more -->

# Where to get it

Nu 0.79 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.79.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

NOTE: The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Themes of this release / New features

## Standard library ([@amtoine, @bobhy, @fdncred, @presidento, ...][stdlib PRs])

This is it. We finally release the standard library with this `0.79`!
It's been on the mind of the core team of Nushell for some time and it was made real between the two releases.

But first of all... **what is the _standard library_?**

The nushell standard library is a **collection of nushell scripts** that are **automatically loaded** in the nushell binary
and **reachable via the `use` command** without any additional setup.

> :bulb: **Note**
> some of the commands from the standard library are `use`d without human intervention as part of what we call
> the _prelude_.
>
> As said above, the other commands are available with the `use` command.
> The goal of this library is, as its name suggests, to provide a _standard_ experience and a _standardized_ set of commands and tools to any Nushell user.
> In `std`, one can find things like

- a test framework to write robust Nushell scripts, modules and libraries
- implementation of builtin commands once written in `rust`
- logging commands with several log levels
- ...

> :bulb: **Note**
> yes, you heard right, in the future, the standard library might become a sanctuary for non-time-critical commands that were once written in `rust`
> as part of the built-in set of commands!
>
> Right now, we are actively trying to move the `help` commands from the `nushell` core implementation to the library.

With this release, the library comes with the following custom commands:
| module | description | commands |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`std assert`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-std/lib/testing.nu) | a set of commands to write tests | `assert`, `assert equal`, `assert error`, `assert greater`, `assert greater or equal`, `assert length`, `assert less`, `assert less or equal`, `assert not equal`, `assert skip`, `assert str contains` |
| [`std dirs`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-std/lib/dirs.nu) | a re-implementation of the `shells` commands | `dirs add`, `dirs drop`, `dirs next`, `dirs prev`, `dirs show` |
| [`std help`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-std/lib/help.nu) | a Nushell implementation of the built-in commands | `help`, `help aliases`, `help commands`, `help externs`, `help modules`, `help operators` |
| [`std iter`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-std/lib/iter.nu) | an extension of built-in commands to iterate over data | `iter filter-map`, `iter find`, `iter intersperse`, `iter scan` |
| [`std log`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-std/lib/log.nu) | never miss something in your scripts | `log critical`, `log debug`, `log error`, `log info`, `log warning` |
| [`xml` module](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-std/lib/xml.nu) | tools to interact with Xml data | `xaccess`, `xinsert`, `xtype`, `xupdate` |

- some other commands live under the `std` namespace, without any module: `clip`, `path add` and `run-tests`

### TL;DR

As there has been quite a lot of contributions already (see the [50 closed PRs][stdlib PRs] at the time i'm writing this :o),
i'm just gonna give some hints and links in this release note, leaving the rest to the amazing work of other contributors who wrote parts of the lib and its documents (shout out to
[@bobhy](https://github.com/bobhy),
[@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) and
[@presidento](https://github.com/presidento)

- the library can be used and tested with

```nushell
use std   # will load the whole library under the `std` namespace
use std * #   -    -   -    -      -    without the `std` prefix
```

or use direct imports, such as

```nushell
use std 'dirs show'
```

- one can follow the activity of the library in the [roadmap](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/8450)
- the library comes with a test framework; see the [_Testing your Nushell code_](https://www.nushell.sh/book/testing.html) chapter of the book
- the long term information, changelog and updates shall be found in the [_Standard library_](https://www.nushell.sh/book/standard_library.html) chapter of the Nushell book
- if you are a contributor willing to help out, everything happens in the [`nu-std` crate](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/tree/main/crates/nu-std), especially the
  [`CONTRIBUTING.md` document](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-std/CONTRIBUTING.md) which explains all there is to know about "_developing with `std`_"
  in great details.

[stdlib PRs]: https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Apr+label%3Astd-library

If, for some reason, you want to load Nushell without the standard library, start `nu` with the `--no-std-lib`. This can be the case if you find the startup times much longer than before. We're aiming to improve the loading speed in the future.

## enhanced IDE support in our VS code extension ([Sophia](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8745), [fdncred](https://github.com/nushell/vscode-nushell-lang/pull/89))

![IDE support](../assets/images/0_79_ide.png)

Nushell now has a first [LSP (Language Server Protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol) implementation with a VSCode integration. If you install the latest version of our [VSCode plugin](https://github.com/nushell/vscode-nushell-lang), you'll see hovers, inlays, tooltips, error squigglies and other features. We are still very early in the LSP development, but the extension is already very usable and definitely moves the experience of writing Nu code to another level!

While currently we have only VSCode integration, the server itself is standalone and we welcome projects adding the LSP support to more editors.

## `atuin` now [supports Nushell](https://atuin.sh/blog/release-v14)

Thanks to [@stevenxxiu](https://github.com/stevenxxiu) you can now use `atuin` with Nushell. We are happy to see Nushell supported by more projects and we welcome PRs adding more integrations.

## Relaxed parsing rules ([Sophia](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8846))

We listened to your feedback around the syntax changes introduced with 0.78 and decided to revert to the old behavior around the parsing rules for numeric literals as well as the compulsory `||` for closures.

## Removed old alias implementation ([kubouch](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8797))

While there are still some missing pieces, we removed the old alias implementation. This means that `old-alias` is no longer available. We decided to remove it to clean up the code. It makes further fixes to aliases easier as you do not need to remember which alias implementation a piece of code belongs to.

There are two notable missing features from the old aliases:

- Missing completions with external completers.
- Most parser keywords (such as `source`) cannot be aliased but adding support for aliasing them should be possible in most cases.
- Not possible to alias with environment shorthands (e.g., `alias foo = FOO=bar spam`)
- Some presentation issues, such as the output of `which` and the alias `usage` pointing at the aliased call instead of the alias itself.

## Changes to default files locations ([ito](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8792)-[hiroki](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/8887))

`$nu.config-path` and `$nu.env-path` are now set based on `--config` and `--env-config` flags passed to Nushell and also use the path after resolving symlinks. This means that they no longer guarantee pointing at the default Nushell's config directory. To be able to refer to the default config directory, `$nu.default-config-dir` was added and used in default `env.nu` to always point `NU_LIB_DIRS` to the `scripts` directory under the default config directory.

Related to that, [`$env.CURRENT_FILE`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8861) was added to be able to show the currently evaluated file.

# Breaking changes

- [#8797](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8797) `old-alias` is no longer available
- [#8724](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8724) `str index-of -r` now uses ranges
- [#8792](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8792) `config nu` and `config env` now open `$nu.config-path` and `$nu.env-path`, respectively.
- [#8779](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8779) Aliasing math expressions now shows error immediately instead of failing silently and showing a confusing error later.
- [#8917](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8917) `exec` inherits Nushell's environment variables
- [#8887](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8887) `NU_LIB_DIRS` definition in `env.nu` changed

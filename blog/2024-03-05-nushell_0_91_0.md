# Nushell 0.91.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->
Today, we're releasing version 0.91.0 of Nu. This release adds...

# Where to get it

Nu 0.91.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.91.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

## REPL Stability and Panic Recovery [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to the work of [@ayax79](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11935) in
[#11860](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11860), [#11935](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11935), and [#11953](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11953),
the Nushell REPL should no longer crash if a panic occurs and should no longer exit if some other error is encountered.
Besides being very convenient, this should also make Nushell safer to use a login shell, since panics would previously cause Nushell to crash on an attempted login.
Similarly, config files that triggered a panic used to prevent a user from starting the REPL.
Now, the REPL falls back to loading the default config files if a panic occurs when loading a user's config.

Note that panics are still important errors/bugs, so please open issues and bug reports if you encounter any!

## Our set of commands is evolving [[toc](#table-of-content)]
As usual, new release rhyms with changes to commands!

### New commands and flags [[toc](#table-of-content)]

- thanks to [@astral-l](https://github.com/astral-l)'s work in [11902](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11902), the `into int` command now has a `--signed` flag for interpreting binary values as signed integers

### Changes to existing commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

- with [#11195](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11858), `rm`, `open`, and `touch` no longer have a required positional parameter
- with [#11807](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11807), `from nuon` now errors if duplicate columns are found
- with [#11808](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11808), `lazy make` now errors if duplicate columns are provided

### Deprecated commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]
### Removed commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

<!-- NOTE: to start investigating the contributions of last release, i like to list them all in a raw table.
    to achieve this, one can use the [`list-merged-prs` script from `nu_scripts`](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs)
    as follows:

    ```nushell
    use ./make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs
    use std clip

    let last_release_date = ^gh api /repos/nushell/nushell/releases
        | from json
        | into datetime published_at
        | get published_at
        | sort
        | last

    let prs = list-merged-prs nushell/nushell $last_release_date
        | where author != "app/dependabot"
        | sort-by mergedAt
        | update url {|it| $"[#($it.number)]\(($it.url)\)" }
        | update author { $"[@($in)]\(https://github.com/($in)\)" }
        | select author title url
        | rename -c {url: pr}
        | to md --pretty

    $prs | to md --pretty | clip
    ```

# Breaking changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]
<!-- TODO:
    paste the output of
    ```nu
    ./make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs nushell/nushell --label breaking-change --pretty --no-author
    ```
    here
-->

- [#11859](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11859) Remove list of cell path support for `select` and `reject`

  `select` and `reject` used to allow lists of cell paths as positional arguments like:

  ```nu
  let cols = [name size]
  ls | select $cols
  ```

  Instead, one should now use the spread operator:

  ```nu
  ls | select ...$cols
  ```

  Or, provide the cell paths directly:

  ```nu
  ls | select name size
  ```

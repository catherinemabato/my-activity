# Nushell 0.75

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.75 of Nu.

# Where to get it

Nu 0.75 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.75.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

NOTE: The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Themes of this release / New features


## `-g` grapheme cluster flags for `str length`, `str substring`, `str index-of`, `split words` and `split chars` ([webbedspace](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7752))

As you know, `str length`, `str substring`, `str index-of` and `split words` measure the length of strings and substrings in UTF-8 bytes, which is often very unintuitive - all non-ASCII characters are of length 2 or more, and splitting a non-ASCII character can create garbage characters as a result. A much better alternative is to measure the length in *extended grapheme clusters*. In Unicode, a "grapheme cluster" tries to map as closely as possible to a single visible character. This means, among many other things:

 * Non-ASCII characters, such as `ん`, are considered single units of length 1, no matter how many UTF-8 bytes they use.
 * Combined characters, such as `e` and `◌́ ` being combined to produce `é`, are considered single units of length 1.
 * Emojis, including combined emojis such as 🇯🇵, which is made of the 🇯 and 🇵 emojis plus a zero-width joiner, are considered single units of length 1. (This is a property of "extended" grapheme clusters.)
 * `"\r\n"` is considered a single unit of length 1.

The new `--graphemes`/`-g` flag can be used with `str length`, `str substring`, `str index-of` and `split words` to enable these length/indexing measurements:

```
〉'🇯🇵ほげ ふが ぴよ'   | str substring 4..6 -g
ふが
〉'🇯🇵ほげ ふが ぴよ'   | str length -g
9
〉'🇯🇵ほげ ふが ぴよ'   | str index-of 'ふが' -g
4
```

In addition, the flag has been added to `split chars`. Notably, this command splits on Unicode code points rather than UTF-8 bytes, so it doesn't have the issue of turning non-ASCII characters into garbage characters. However, combining emoji and combining characters do not correspond to single code points, and are split by `split chars`. The `-g` flag keeps those characters intact:

```
〉'🇯🇵ほげ' | split chars -g | to nuon
[🇯🇵, ほ, げ]
```

These commands also have `--utf-8-bytes`/`-b` flags which enable the legacy behavior (and `split chars` has `--code-points`/`-c`). These currently *do not do anything* and need not strictly be used, since UTF-8 byte lengths are still the default behaviour. However, if this default someday changes, then these flags will guarantee that the legacy behaviour is used.

::: tip

It is currently being debated whether or not grapheme clusters should be used as the default string length measurement in Nushell (making the `-g` flag the default behaviour for these commands), due to their intuitiveness, consistency across non-Latin scripts, and better correspondence to the length of strings displayed in the terminal (after stripping ANSI codes). Currently, the Nushell developers are uncertain what the long-term impact of such a change would be, whether existing scripts would be non-trivially harmed by it, or whether it would hinder interoperability with external programs. If you have any personal insight or opinion about this change, or about which behaviour you'd prefer not to require a flag, your input is desired!

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Pipelines to control any OS">
    Nu works on Linux, macOS, BSD, and Windows. Learn it once, then use it
    anywhere.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Everything is data">
    Nu pipelines use structured data so you can safely select, filter, and sort
    the same way every time. Stop parsing strings and start solving problems.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Powerful plugins">
    It's easy to extend Nu using a powerful plugin system.
  </Card>

## Nu works with existing data

Nu speaks [JSON, YAML, SQLite, Excel, and more](https://www.nushell.sh/book/loading_data) out of the box. It's easy to bring data into a Nu pipeline whether it's in a file, a database, or a web API:

## Nu has great error messages

Nu operates on typed data, so it catches bugs that other shells don't. And when things break, Nu tells you exactly where and why:

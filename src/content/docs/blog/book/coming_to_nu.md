title: Coming to Nu
---

If you are familiar with other shells or programming languages, you might find this chapter useful to get up to speed.

[Coming from Bash](coming_from_bash) shows how some patterns typical for Bash, or POSIX shells in general, can be mapped to Nushell.
Similarly, [Coming from CMD.EXE](coming_from_cmd) shows how built-in commands in the Windows Command Prompt can be mapped to Nushell.

Similar comparisons are made for some [other shells and domain-specific languages](nushell_map), [imperative languages](nushell_map_imperative), and [functional languages](nushell_map_functional).
A separate comparison is made specifically for [operators](nushell_operator_map).

Let's get started! :elephant:

First, to be able to use Nushell, we need to [install it](/book/installation).

The next sections will give you a [short tour of Nushell by example](/book/quick_tour) (including how to get help from within Nushell), and show you how to [move around your file system](/book/moving_around).

Finally, because Nushell takes some design decisions that are quite different from typical shells or dynamic scripting languages, make sure to check [Thinking in Nu](/book/thinking_in_nu) that explains some of these concepts.

# Readme

In this section we have put together a start to a language guide.

The thought here is to have an outline where people can contribute in "small" ways in areas that they are familiar with.

There needs to be some topics added and I see that there are perhaps some duplicate areas that need to be cleaned up. I was kind of trying to mimic this document off of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/About and https://phel-lang.org/documentation/getting-started/. There may be others that we would prefer to model. Speak up if you have one.

The hope would be to provide a little bit of documentation text for context and then a lot of examples of usage.

# Error

What it is: The data type generated by the `error make` command and other internal commands.

Annotation: `error`

At the present time, this data type is not useful as a proper Nushell data type. When the `error make` command is called, the system throws an exception so you cannot really capture the actual value generated by the `error make` command.

If you surround the code that might potentially throw such an error with a try/catch code block, the error, if thrown will be captured by the catch sub-expression. The parameter passed to the closure given to the catch expression, is a record data type, not an error type.

The error annotation can be used to type a custom command parameter, or the command's return type. It cannot be used to type either a mutable or innutable variable nor the input type for a custom command. But doing so has no effect.

This code snippet shows how to detect the error data type from within Nushell:

```nu
do { error make {msg: 'can we see this?'} } | describe
error
```

# Duration

- **_Description:_** Represent a unit of a passage of time
- **_Annotation:_** `duration`
- **_Literal Syntax:_** A numeric (integer or decimal) literal followed immediately by a duration unit (listed below). E.g., `10sec`, `987us`, `-34.65day`
- **_Casts:_** [`into duration`](/commands/docs/into_duration.md)

Durations are internally stored as a number of nanoseconds.

This chart shows all duration units currently supported:

| Duration  | Length          |
| --------- | --------------- |
| `ns`      | one nanosecond  |
| `us`/`Î¼s` | one microsecond |
| `ms`      | one millisecond |
| `sec`     | one second      |
| `min`     | one minute      |
| `hr`      | one hour        |
| `day`     | one day         |
| `wk`      | one week        |

Datetime values can be combined with durations in calculations:

```nu
> (date now) + 1day
Tue, 13 Aug 2024 11:49:27 -0400 (in a day)
> 2024-08-12T11:50:30-04:00 - 2019-05-10T09:59:12-07:00
274wk 2day 22hr 51min 18sec
```

::: tip Note
Months, years, centuries and millenniums are not precise as to the exact
number of nanoseconds and thus are not valid duration literals. Users are free to define
their own constants for specific months or years.

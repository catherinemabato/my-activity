| **_Description:_**            | An expression that is used to navigated to an inner value in a structured value.                                                                                                                          |
| **_Annotation:_**             | `cell-path`                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **_Literal syntax example:_** | A dot-separated list of row (int) and column (string) IDs. E.g., `name.4.5`. Optionally, use a leading `$.` when needed for disambiguation, such as when assigning a cell-path to a variable (see below). |
| **_Casts:_**                  | [`into cell-path`](/commands/docs/into_cell-path.md)                                                                                                                                                      |
| **_See also:_**               | [Navigating and Accessing Structured Data](/book/navigating_structured_data.md) for an in-depth overview.                                                                                                 |

## Literal Syntax Options

- Relaxed form:

  ```nu
  > $data | get name.5
  ```

- Leading `$.` form:

  When assigning a cell path to a variable, the leading `$.` syntax is required:

  ```nu
  > let cp: cell-path = name.5
  # => Error
  > let cp: cell-path = $.name.5

  This is not required when using cell-path arguments to a custom command.
  ```

## Additional Language Notes

1. Ordering

   - When accessing a cell in a table using a cell-path, either the row index or the column name can be listed first.

     ```nu
     > ls | get name.0
     # Returns the name of the first file
     > ls | get 0.name
     # Same result - The name of the first file
     ```

- However, when accessing **nested** data, the ordering of _subsequent_ (nested) rows and columns is important.

  Using the [nested weather data example](/book/navigating_structured_data.md#tables):

  ```nu
  # Accesses the second day, third temperature
  > $data.1.temps.2
  34.91
  # Also accesses the second day, third temperature
  > $data.temps.1.2
  34.91
  # Accesses the third day, second temperature
  > $data.temps.2.1
  36.67
  ```

  Notice that the first row/column can be swapped without changing the meaning, but swapping the position of the two row indices results in a different path.

1. `cell-path` can be used as a type annotation.

   Example: A pure-Nushell implementation of the versatile `get` command.

   ```nu
   def my-get [p: cell-path] {
   get $p
   }

   # Now call it
   [1 2 3 4] | my-get 2
   # => 3
   # structured data
   {foo: 1, bar: { baz: {quo: 4}}} | my-get bar.baz.quo
   # => 4
   # with the $ prefix
   {foo: 1, bar: { baz: {quo: 4}}} | my-get $.bar.baz.quo
   # => 4
   # Create a var: $p
   let p: cell-path = $.bar.baz.quo
   # works so far
   # let's try for standard get
   {foo: 1, bar: { baz: {quo: 4}}} | get $p
   # => 4
   # Now with my-get
   {foo: 1, bar: { baz: {quo: 4}}} | my-get $p
   # => 4
   ```

1. Cell-paths are not restricted to just the literal values demonstrated above. Cell-paths can also be constructed programmatically using the [`into cell-path`](/commands/docs/into_cell-path.md) command.

   For example, you can construct the cell path in the temp data programmatically with this code which knows that the location desired is for Grand Rapids, Mich., U.S.A.

   ```nu
   let grr = 2 # using IATA codes for variable names
   let cp: cell-path = ([3, temps, $grr] | into cell-path)
   $data | get $cp
   # returns just temps for GRR
   ```

## Common commands that can be used with `cell-path`

- `get`
- `select`
- `update`/`upsert`

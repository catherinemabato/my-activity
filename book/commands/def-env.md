# <code>def-env</code> for core

<div class='command-title'>Define a custom command, which participates in the caller environment</div>

## Notes

This command is a parser keyword. For details, check:
  https://www.nushell.sh/book/thinking_in_nu.html

=== EXTRA NOTE ===
All blocks are scoped, including variable definition and environment variable changes.

Because of this, the following doesn't work:

def-env cd_with_fallback [arg = ""] {
    let fall_back_path = "/tmp"
    if $arg != "" {
        cd $arg
    } else {
        cd $fall_back_path
    }
}

Instead, you have to use cd in the top level scope:

def-env cd_with_fallback [arg = ""] {
    let fall_back_path = "/tmp"
    let path = if $arg != "" {
        $arg
    } else {
        $fall_back_path
    }
    cd $path
}

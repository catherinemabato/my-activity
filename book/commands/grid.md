# <code>grid</code> for viewers

<div class='command-title'>Renders the output to a textual terminal grid.</div>

## Notes

grid was built to give a concise gridded layout for ls. however,
it determines what to put in the grid by looking for a column named
'name'. this works great for tables and records but for lists we
need to do something different. such as with '[one two three] | grid'
it creates a fake column called 'name' for these values so that it
prints out the list properly.

## Signature

```> grid {flags}```

## Flags

 * ```-h, --help```: Display this help message
 * ```-w, --width <Int>```: number of terminal columns wide (not output columns)
 * ```-c, --color```: draw output with color
 * ```-s, --separator <String>```: character to separate grid with
## Examples

  Render a simple list to a grid
```shell
  > [1 2 3 a b c] | grid
```
  The above example is the same as:
```shell
  > [1 2 3 a b c] | wrap name | grid
```
  Render a record to a grid
```shell
  > {name: 'foo', b: 1, c: 2} | grid
```
  Render a list of records to a grid
```shell
  > [{name: 'A', v: 1} {name: 'B', v: 2} {name: 'C', v: 3}] | grid
```
  Render a table with 'name' column in it to a grid
```shell
  > [[name patch]; [0.1.0 false] [0.1.1 true] [0.2.0 false]] | grid
```

# <code>encode</code> for strings

<div class='command-title'>Encode an UTF-8 string into other kind of representations.</div>

## Notes

Multiple encodings are supported, here is an example of a few:
big5, euc-jp, euc-kr, gbk, iso-8859-1, cp1252, latin5

Note that since the Encoding Standard doesn't specify encoders for utf-16le and utf-16be, these are not yet supported.

documentation link at https://docs.rs/encoding_rs/0.8.28/encoding_rs/#statics

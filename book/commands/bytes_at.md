<div class='command-title'>Get bytes defined by a range. Note that the start is included but the end is excluded, and that the first byte is index 0.</div>

## Signature

```> bytes at <range> ...(rest)```

## Flags

 * ```-h, --help```: Display this help message
## Parameters

 * ```range <Any>```: the indexes to get bytes
 * ```...rest <CellPath>```: optionally get bytes by column paths
## Examples

  Get a subbytes `0x[10 01]` from the bytes `0x[33 44 55 10 01 13]`
```shell
  >  0x[33 44 55 10 01 13] | bytes at [3 4]
```
  Alternatively, you can use the form
```shell
  >  0x[33 44 55 10 01 13] | bytes at '3,4'
```
  Drop the last `n` characters from the string
```shell
  >  0x[33 44 55 10 01 13] | bytes at ',-3'
```
  Get the remaining characters from a starting index
```shell
  >  0x[33 44 55 10 01 13] | bytes at '3,'
```
  Get the characters from the beginning until ending index
```shell
  >  0x[33 44 55 10 01 13] | bytes at ',4'
```
  Or the characters from the beginning until ending index inside a table
```shell
  >  [[ColA ColB ColC]; [0x[11 12 13] 0x[14 15 16] 0x[17 18 19]]] | bytes at "1," ColB ColC
```

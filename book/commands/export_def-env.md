<div class='command-title'>Define a custom command that participates in the environment and export it from a module</div>

## Notes

This command is a parser keyword. For details, check:
  https://www.nushell.sh/book/thinking_in_nu.html

=== EXTRA NOTE ===
All blocks are scoped, including variable definition and environment variable changes.

Because of this, the following doesn't work:

export def-env cd_with_fallback [arg = ""] {
    let fall_back_path = "/tmp"
    if $arg != "" {
        cd $arg
    } else {
        cd $fall_back_path
    }
}

Instead, you have to use cd in the top level scope:

export def-env cd_with_fallback [arg = ""] {
    let fall_back_path = "/tmp"
    let path = if $arg != "" {
        $arg
    } else {
        $fall_back_path
    }
    cd $path
}

## Signature

```> export def-env <name> <params> <block>```

## Flags

 * ```-h, --help```: Display this help message
## Parameters

 * ```name <String>```: definition name
 * ```params <Signature>```: parameters

## Examples

```shell
  > module foo { export def-env bar [] { let-env FOO_BAR = "BAZ" } }; use foo bar; bar; $env.FOO_BAR
```

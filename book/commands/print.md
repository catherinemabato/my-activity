# <code>print</code> for strings

<div class='command-title'>Print the given values to stdout</div>

## Notes

Unlike `echo`, this command does not return any value (`print | describe` will return "nothing").
Since this command has no output, there is no point in piping it with other commands.

`print` may be used inside blocks of code (e.g.: hooks) to display text during execution without interfering with the pipeline.

## Signature

```> print {flags} ...(rest)```

## Flags

 * ```-h, --help```: Display this help message
 * ```-n, --no-newline```: print without inserting a newline for the line ending
 * ```-e, --stderr```: print to stderr instead of stdout
## Parameters

 * ```...rest <Any>```: the values to print
## Examples

  Print 'hello world'
```shell
  > print "hello world"
```
  Print the sum of 2 and 3
```shell
  > print (2 + 3)
```

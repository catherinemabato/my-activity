# <code>watch</code> for filesystem

<div class='command-title'>Watch for file changes and execute Nu code when they happen.</div>

## Signature

```> watch {flags} <path> <block>```

## Flags

 * ```-h, --help```: Display this help message
 * ```-d, --debounce-ms <Int>```: Debounce changes for this many milliseconds (default: 100). Adjust if you find that single writes are reported as multiple events
 * ```-g, --glob <String>```: Only report changes for files that match this glob pattern (default: all files)
 * ```-r, --recursive <Boolean>```: Watch all directories under `<path>` recursively. Will be ignored if `<path>` is a file (default: true)
 * ```-v, --verbose```: Operate in verbose mode (default: false)
## Parameters

 * ```path <Filepath>```: the path to watch. Can be a file or directory
 * ```block <Block(None)>```: A Nu block of code to run whenever a file changes. The block will be passed `operation`, `path`, and `new_path` (for renames only) arguments in that order
## Examples

  Run `cargo test` whenever a Rust file changes
```shell
  > watch . --glob=**/*.rs { cargo test }
```
  Watch all changes in the current directory
```shell
  > watch . { |op, path, new_path| $"($op) ($path) ($new_path)"}
```
  Log all changes in a directory
```shell
  > watch /foo/bar { |op, path| $"($op) - ($path)(char nl)" | save --append changes_in_bar.log }
```

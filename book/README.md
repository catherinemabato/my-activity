# Introduction

Hello, and welcome to the Nushell project.
The goal of this project is to take the Unix philosophy of shells, where pipes connect simple commands together, and bring it to the modern style of development.
Thus, rather than being either a shell, or a programming language, Nushell connects both by bringing a rich programming language and a full-featured shell together into one package.

Nu takes cues from a lot of familiar territory: traditional shells like bash, object based shells like PowerShell, gradually typed languages like TypeScript, functional programming, systems programming, and more. But rather than trying to be a jack of all trades, Nu focuses its energy on doing a few things well:

- Being a flexible cross-platform shell with a modern feel
- Solving problems as a modern programming language that works with the structure of your data
- Giving clear error messages and clean IDE support

## This Book

The book is split into chapters which are further broken down into sections.
You can click on the chapter headers to get more information about it.

- [Getting Started](getting_started.md) teaches you how to install Nushell and shows you the ropes. It also explains some of the design principles where Nushell differs from typical shells, such as bash.
- [Nu Fundamentals](nu_fundamentals.md) explains basic concepts of the Nushell language.
- [Programming in Nu](programming_in_nu.md) dives more deeply into the language features and shows several ways how to organize and structure your code.
- [Nu as a Shell](nu_as_a_shell.md) focuses on the shell features, most notably the configuration and environment.
- [Coming to Nu](coming_to_nu.md) is intended to give a quick start for users coming from other shells or languages.
- [Advanced](advanced.md) includes some more advanced topics (they are not _so_ advanced, make sure to check them out, too!).

# Overlays

**This page is under construction.**

_Note: To understand overlays, make sure to check [Modules](modules.md) first as overlays build on top of modules._

Overlays act as "layers" of definitions (custom commands, aliases, environment variables) that can be activated and deactivated on demand.
They resemble virtual environments found in some languages, such as Python.

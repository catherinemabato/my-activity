# Math

Sometimes, you just need to add a few numbers when you're working on a task. Nu offers a set of basic math operations that you can use. Math expressions are available wherever you can call a command.

## Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide

```
> 1 + 3
4
```

In Nu, you can do the usual add, subtract, multiply and divide with the operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` respectively. Operator precedence is respected, so `1 + 2 * 3` will be treated as `1 + (2 * 3)`. Which leads us to another concept: parentheses.

## Parentheses

You can use parentheses to group math expression in math mode. This allows you to write `(1 + 2) * 3` if you want the addition to have higher precedence.

## `in` and `not-in`

You can check if a value is in a set of values or not using the `in` and `not-in` operators.

```
> 1 in [1 2 3]
true
```

```
> 1 not-in [1 2 3]
false
```

## =~ and !~

You can check to see if a string is inside of another string, or not inside of another string, using `=~` and `!~`.

```
> "foobar" =~ "foo"
true
```

```
> "foobar" !~ "baz"
true
```

## Comparisons

The following comparisons are also available:

- `<` - less than
- `<=` - less than or equal to
- `>` - greater than
- `>=` - greater than or equal to
- `==` - equal to
- `!=` - not equal to

## Compound operators

Nushell also supports `&&` and `||` to join two operations that return boolean values, using 'and' and 'or' respectively. For example: `ls | where name in ["one" "two" "three"] && size > 10kb`

## Order of operations

Math operations are evaluated in the follow order (from highest precedence to lowest):

- Parentheses (`()`)
- Multiply (`*`) and Divide (`/`)
- Add (`+`) and Subtract (`-`)

```
> 3 * (1 + 2)
9
```

## Short-hand math mode

A variation of math mode that Nushell supports is called "short-hand" math mode. This is because it gives you a way of accessing columns using a simple short-hand.

You may have already used this functionality before. If, for example, we wanted to only see rows from `ls` where the entry is at least ten kilobytes, we can write:

```
> ls | where size > 10kb
```

The `where size > 10kb` is a command with two parts: the command name `where` and the short-hand math expression `size > 10kb`. We say short-hand because `size` here is the shortened version of writing `$it.size`. If we look at the fully expanded form, we would see:

```
> ls | where {|$it| $it.size > 10kb }
```

Rather than having to type all this out every time a command needs to work with column data, we use this short-hand mode to access column data.

For the expansion to work, the column name must appear on the left-hand side of the operation. Above, `size` appears on the left-hand side of the comparison, which allows the expression to expand into the full math mode block.

                As we autogenerate these command pages from the help information defined with the command after each release:
                  - If you already updated the command help, you are already done!
                  - Else, please look for the command in the [source tree](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/tree/main/crates) and make your changes directly there.
                
                Thanks for helping out!`
